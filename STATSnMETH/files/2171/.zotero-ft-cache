Abstract 
 
This article summarizes a research project that evaluated fifty reactionnaire forms that are regularly administered by a prestigious medical school. Four areas of survey design and development were examined. Results indicated that a thorough assessment of currently used reactionnaire forms is likely to locate weaknesses and that appropriate revisions would benefit evaluators, instructors, and learners.
