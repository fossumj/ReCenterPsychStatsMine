											<h2>An introduction to psychometric theory with applications in R</h2>
											<h3>An Overview</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This page is devoted to teaching others about psychometric 
theory as well as R. It consists of chapters of an in progress text as 
well as various short courses on R.
										</p>
										<p>
											The e-book is a work in progress. Chapters will appear 
sporadically. Parts of it are from the draft of a book being prepared 
for the Springer series on using R, other parts are just interesting 
tid-bits that would not be appropriate as chapters.
										</p>
										<p>
											It is written in the hope that I can instill in a new 
generation of psychologists the love for quantitative methodology 
imparted to me by reading the popular and then later the scientific 
texts of Ray Cattell [Cattell, 1966b] and Hans Eysenck [Eysenck, 1964, 
Eysenck, 1953, Eysenck, 1965]. Those Penguin and Pelican paperbacks by 
Cattell and Eysenck were the first indications that I had that it was 
possible to study personality and psychology with a quantitative 
approach.
										</p>
										<p>
											My <a href="http://personality-project.org/courses/405.syllabus.html">course in psychometric theory</a>,
 on which much of this book is based, was inspired by a course of the 
same name by Warren Norman. The organizational structure of this text 
owes a great deal to the structure of Warren's course. Warren introduced
 me, as well as a generation of graduate students at the University of 
Michigan, to the role of theory and measurement in the study of 
psychology. He introduced to me to the "bible" of psychometrics: Jum 
Nunnally's Psychometric Theory [Nunnally, 1967].
										</p>
										<p>
											The students in my psychometric theory classes over the 
years, by their continuing questions and sometimes confusion, have given
 me the motivation to try to make this text as understandable and useful
 as I can. The members of the Society of Multivariate Experimental 
Psychology, by their willingness to share cutting (and sometimes 
bleeding) edge ideas freely and with respect for alternative 
interpretations have been a never ending source of new and exciting 
ideas.
										</p>
										<p>
											This book would not be possible without the amazing 
contributions of the R-Core Team and the many contributers to R and the 
R-Help listserve. 
										</p>
										 <p> Lecture notes to accompany these chapters are found in the syllabus for my course on <a href="http://personality-project.org/revelle/syllabi/405.syllabus.html"> psychometric theory</a>.

										<p>
											Psychometrics is that area of psychology that specializes in 
how to measure what we talk and think about. It is how to assign numbers
 to observations in a way that best allows us to summarize our 
observations in order to advance our knowledge. Although in particular 
it is the study of how to measure psychological constructs, the 
techniques of psychometrics are applicable to most problems in 
measurement. The measurement of intelligence, extraversion, severity of 
crimes, or even batting averages in baseball are all grist for the 
psychometric mill. Any set of observations that are not perfect 
exemplars of the construct of interest is open to questions of 
reliability and validity and to psychometric analysis.
										</p>
										<p>
											Although it is possible to make the study of psychometrics 
seem dauntingly difficult, in fact the basic concepts are 
straightforward. This text is an attempt to introduce the fundamental 
concepts in psychometric theory so that the reader will be able to 
understand how to apply them to real data sets of interest. It is not 
meant to make one an expert, but merely to instill confidence and an 
understanding of the fundamentals of measurement so that the reader can 
better understand and contribute to the research enterprise.

										</header>
										<p>
											At first glance, it would seem that we have an infinite way 
to collect data. Measuring the diameter of the earth by finding the 
distance to the horizon, measuring the height of waves produced by a 
nuclear blast by nailing (empty) beer cans to a palm tree, or finding 
Avogadro's number by dropping oil into water are techniques that do not 
require great sophistication in the theory of measurement. In psychology
 we can use self report, peer ratings, reaction times, 
psychophysiological measures such as the Electric Encephelagram (EEG), 
the basal level of Skin Conductance (SC), or the Galvanic Skin Response 
(GSR). We can measure the number of voxels showing activation greater 
than some threshold in a functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI), or 
we can measure life time risk of cancer, length of life, risk of 
mortality, etc. Indeed, the basic forms of data we can collect probably 
are unlimited. But in fact, it is possible to organize these disparate 
forms of data in terms of an abstract organization in terms of what is 
being measured and in comparison to what.
										</p>

											<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: The Problem of Scale - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/Chapter3.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The challenge of psychometrics is assign numbers to 
observations in a way that best summarizes the underlying constructs. 
The ways to collect observations are multiple and can be based upon 
comparisons of order or of proximity (Chapter 2). But given a set of 
observations, how best to describe them? This is a problem not just for 
observational but also for experimental psychologists for both 
approaches are attempting to make inferences about latent variables in 
terms of statistics based upon observed variables.
										</p>
										<p>
											For the experimentalist, the problem becomes interpreting the
 effect of an experimental manipulation upon some outcome variable in 
terms of the effect of manipulation on the latent outcome variable and 
the relationship between the latent and observed outcome variables. For 
the observationalist, the observed correlation between the observed 
Person Variable and Outcome variable is interpreted as a function of the
 relationship between the latent person trait variable and the observed 
trait variable, the latent outcome variable and the observed outcome 
variable and most importantly for inference, the relationship between 
the two latent variables.
										</p>

											<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Correlation and Covariance - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/chapter4.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											A fundamental question in science is how to measure the 
relationship between two variables. The answer, developed in the late 
19th century, in the the form of the correlation coefficient is arguably
 the most important contribution to psychological theory and method- 
ology in the past two centuries. Whether we are examining the effect of 
education upon later income, of parental height upon the height of 
offspring, or the likelihood of graduating from college as a function of
 SAT score, the question remains the same: what is the strength of the 
relationship? This chapter examines measures of relationship between two
 variables. Generalizations to the problem of how to measure the 
relationships between sets of variables (multiple correlation and 
multiple regression) are left to Chapter 5.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/chapter5.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											 The previous chapter considered how to determine the 
relationship between two variables and how to predict one from the 
other. The general solution was to consider the ratio of the covariance 
between two variables to the variance of the predictor variable 
(regression) or the ratio of the covariance to the square root of the 
product the variances (correlation). This solution may be generalized to
 the problem of how to predict a single variable from the weighted 
linear sum of multiple variables (multiple regression) or to measure the
 strength of this relationship (multiple correlation). As part of the 
problem of finding the weights, the concepts of partial covariance and 
partial correlation will be introduced. To do all of this will require 
finding the variance of a composite score, and the covariance of this 
composite with another score, which might itself be a composite. Much of
 psychometric theory is merely an extension, an elaboration, or a 
generalization of these concepts. Almost all tests are composites of 
items or subtests. An understanding how to decompose test variance into 
its component parts, and conversely, an understanding how to analyze 
tests as composites of items, allows us to analyze the meaning of tests.
 But tests are not merely composites of items. Tests relate to other 
tests. A deep appreciation of the basic Pearson correlation coefficient 
facilitates an understanding of its generalization to multiple and 
partial correlation, to factor analysis, and to questions of validity.

											<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6: Constructs, Components, and Factor Models - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/Chapter6.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Parsimony of description has been a goal of science since at 
least the famous dictum commonly attributed to William of Ockham to not 
multiply entities beyond necessity1. The goal for parsimony is seen in 
psychometrics as an attempt either to describe (components) or to 
explain (factors) the relationships between many observed variables in 
terms of a more limited set of components or latent factors.
										</p>
										<p>
											The typical data matrix represents multiple items or scales 
usually thought to reflect fewer underlying constructs2. At the most 
simple, a set of items can be be thought of representing random samples 
from one underlying domain or perhaps a small set of domains. The ques- 
tion for the psychometrician is how many domains are represented and how
 well does each item represent the domains. Solutions to this problem 
are examples of factor analysis (FA), principal components analysis 
(PCA), and cluster analysis (CA). All of these procedures aim to reduce 
the complexity of the observed data. In the case of FA, the goal is to 
identify fewer underlying constructs to explain the observed data. In 
the case of PCA, the goal can be mere data reduction, but the 
interpretation of components is frequently done in terms similar to 
those used when describing the latent variables estimated by FA. Cluster
 analytic techniques, although usually used to partition the subject 
space rather than the variable space, can also be used to group 
variables to reduce the complexity of the data by forming fewer and more
 homogeneous sets of tests or items.

											<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7: Reliability - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/Chapter7.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Whether discussing ability, affect, or climate change, as 
scientists we are interested in the relationships between our 
theoretical constructs. We recognize, however, that our measure- ments 
are not perfect and that any particular observation has some unknown 
amount of error associated with that measurement for all measurement is 
befuddled by error (McNemar, 1946, p 294). When estimating central 
tendencies, the confidence interval of the mean may be estimated by the 
standard error of the sample observations, and may be calculated from 
the observed standard deviation and the number of observations. This is,
 of course, the basic concept of Gossett and Fisher.
										</p>
										<p>
											Error may be both random as well systematic. Random error 
reflects trial by trial variabil- ity due to unknown sources while 
systematic error may reflect situational or individual effects that may 
be specified. Perhaps the classic example of systematic error (known as 
the personal equation) is the analysis of individual differences in 
reaction time in making astronomical observations. "The personal 
equation of an observer is the interval of time which habitually 
intervenes between the actual and the observed transit of a star..." 
(Rogers, 1869). Before systematic individual differences were analyzed, 
the British astronomer Maskelyn fired his as- sistant Kennebrook for 
making measurements that did not agree with his own (Stigler, 1986). 
Subsequent investigations of the systematic bias (Safford, 1898; 
Sanford, 1889) showed con- sistent individual differences as well as the
 effect of situational manipulations such as hunger and sleep 
deprivation (Rogers, 1869).

											<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8: Item Response Theory - <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/Chapter8.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Classical test theory is concerned with the reliability of a 
test and assumes that the items within the test are sampled at random 
from a domain of relevant items. Reliability is seen as a characteristic
 of the test and of the variance of the trait it measures. Items are 
treated as random replicates of each other and their characteristics, if
 examined at all, are expressed as correlations with total test score or
 as factor loadings on the putative latent variable(s) of interest. 
Characteristics of their properties are not analyzed in detail. This led
 Mellenbergh (1996) to the distinction between theories of tests (Lord 
and Novick, 1968) and a theories of items (Lord, 1952; Rasch, 1960). The
 so-called "New Psychometrics" (Embretson and Hershberger, 1999; 
Embretson and Reise, 2000; Van der Linden and Hambleton, 1997) is a 
theory of how people respond to items and is known as Item Response 
Theory or IRT. Over the past twenty years there has been explosive 
growth in programs that can do IRT, and within R there are at least four
 very powerful packages: eRm (Mair and Hatzinger, 2007), ltm Rizopoulos 
(2006), lme4 (Doran et al., 2007) and MiscPsycho, (Doran, 2010). 
Additional packages include mokken (van der Ark, 2010) to do non-metric 
IRT and plink (Weeks, 2010) to link multiple groups together. More IRT 
packages are being added all of the time.
