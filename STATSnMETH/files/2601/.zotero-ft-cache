Description 
 
The goal of the chapters in this SIOP Organizational Frontiers Series volume is to challenge researchers to break away from the rote application of traditional methodologies and to capitalize upon the wealth of data collection and analytic strategies available to them. In that spirit, many of the chapters in this book deal with methodologies that encourage organizational scientists to re-conceptualize phenomena of interest (e.g., experience sampling, catastrophe modeling), employ novel data collection strategies (e.g., data mining, Petri nets), and/or apply sophisticated analytic techniques (e.g., latent class analysis). The editors believe that these chapters provide compelling solutions for the complex problems faced by organizational researchers.
