Adding Value and Solving Problems: Virtual Networking for Scientists 
 
How do you make meaningful connections when research and scientific events are all taking place online? The Association for Psychological Science has partnered with STEM career consultant Alaina Levine to help APS members improve their networking skills and develop strategies to build collaborations online. 
 
At its core, networking is all about crafting win-win alliances where both parties provide value. You may think that “networking” can only take place in person, but this is a myth! In fact, most networking takes place from afar, and in some cases, the individuals may never even meet in person. 
 
In this webinar, learn how to: 
 
    Develop strategies and tactics for finding new collaborators 
    Build mutually-beneficial partnerships with professionals across the globe 
    Utilize various methods to find and reach out to people 
    Nurture critical conversations necessary for collaborations
