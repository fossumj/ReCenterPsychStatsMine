Description 
REVEL™ is Pearson’s newest way of delivering our respected content. Fully digital and highly engaging, REVEL replaces the textbook and gives students everything they need for the course. Informed by extensive research on how people read, think, and learn, REVEL is an interactive learning environment that enables students to read, practice, and study in one continuous experience — for less than the cost of a traditional textbook. 
 
A practical and theoretically rich guide to conducting psychological research 
REVEL for Research Design in Clinical Psychology helps students achieve a thorough understanding of the entire research process — developing the idea, selecting methods, analyzing the results, and preparing the written scientific report. Drawing examples from clinical research, health, and medicine, author Alan Kazdin offers detailed coverage of experimental design, assessment, data evaluation and interpretation, case-control and cohort designs, and qualitative research methods. In addition to new pedagogical tools to guide students, REVEL for the Fifth Edition offers expanded coverage of key topic areas, such as cultural issues, scientific integrity, and recent changes in the publication and communication of research.

Features 
Features 
Dynamic content matched to the way today's students read, think, and learn brings content to life 
 
    Integrated within the narrative, interactives empower students to engage with concepts and take an active role in learning. REVEL's unique presentation of media as an intrinsic part of course content brings the hallmark features of Pearson's bestselling titles to life. REVEL's media interactives have been designed to be completed quickly, so students stay focused and on task. 
    End-of-chapter quizzing affords students opportunities to check their understanding before moving on. 
    REVEL’s fully mobile learning experience enables students to read and interact with course material on the devices they use, anywhere and anytime. Responsive design allows students to access REVEL on their tablet devices and smart phones, with content displayed clearly in both portrait and landscape view. 
    Highlighting, note taking, and a glossary let students read and study however they like. Educators can add notes for students, too, including reminders or study tips. 
 
 
Superior assignability and tracking tools help educators make sure students are completing their reading and understanding core concepts 
 
    REVEL’s assignment calendar allows educators to indicate precisely which readings must be completed on which dates. This clear, detailed schedule helps students stay on task by eliminating any ambiguity as to which material will be covered during each class. And when students know what is expected of them, they're better motivated to keep up. 
    REVEL’s performance dashboard lets educators monitor class assignment completion as well as individual student achievement. It offers actionable information that helps educators intersect with their students in meaningful ways, such as points earned on quizzes and tests and time on task. Of particular note, the trending column reveals whether students' grades are improving or declining – which helps educators identify students who might need help to stay on track. 
 
 
Balanced coverage of theory and practice fosters a thorough understanding of the discipline 
 
    The authors present fully integrated coverage of psychological and scientific principles to help students see psychological research in the context of scientific research. 
    Discussion of alternative research methods , including single-case research designs and qualitative research, helps students to understand the wide range of methodological options that are available for researchers. 
    Extensive material on ethical issues highlights the fact that ethical issues are central to research and are important to consider at the design stage. Throughout the text, the ethical and professional responsibilities of the investigator are discussed. 
    The inclusion of studies on the effects of psychotherapy and characteristics of depression help students understand key concepts while fostering interest in the course. 
    The role that clinical psychology plays in research on violence, crime, homelessness, and substance abuse is examined throughout the text. 
 
 
Updated and expanded discussions reflect the latest changes in the field 
 
    NEW! The Fifth Edition includes numerous additions and changes to reflect the evolving and dynamic nature of psychological science and methodology, as well as ways of carrying out studies. Key changes include greater attention to the following topic areas: 
        How to develop a research idea and what makes a research study interesting and important; 
        Use of technology and Web-based methods to conduct studies; 
        Cultural and ethnic issues and how and why they essential to integrate into research; 
        Decision making in analyzing the results and points where bias often is introduced; 
        Ethical issues and scientific integrity and their pervasive role in the research process from beginning to end; 
        Publication bias, “negative” results, and current priorities related to replication; and 
        Changes in the publication and communication of research that can affect both researchers and consumers of research. 
 
  
Pedagogical tools guide students through the text 
 
    NEW! Tables summarize key points and serve as useful study guides. 
    NEW! A chapter summary at the end of each chapter enables students to review key concepts. 
    NEW! A list of readings included at the end of the text, organized by chapter, directs the interested reader to more in-depth presentations of topics.  
    NEW! A glossary at the end of the text defines key terms introduced throughout the chapters.
