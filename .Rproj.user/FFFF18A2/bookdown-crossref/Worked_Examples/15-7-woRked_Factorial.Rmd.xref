Narrate the research vignette, describing the IV and DV. Miniminally, the data should allow the analysis of a 2 x 3 (or 3 X 2) design. At least one of the problems you work should have a significant interaction effect so that follow-up is required.

Calculate sums of squares total (SST) for the omnibus ANOVA. Steps in this calculation must include calculating a grand mean and creating variables representing the mean deviation and mean deviation squared.
h4:calculate-the-sums-of-squares-for-the-model-ssm-for-the-omnibus-anova.-a-necessary-step-in-this-equation-is-to-calculate-group-means-for-all-combinations-of-the-levels-in-the-factorial-design. Calculate the sums of squares for the model (SSM) for the omnibus ANOVA. A necessary step in this equation is to calculate group means for all combinations of the levels in the factorial design.
h4:calculate-the-sums-of-squares-residual-ssr-for-the-omnibus-anova.-a-necessary-step-in-this-equation-is-to-calculate-the-variance-for-each-group. Calculate the sums of squares residual (SSR) for the omnibus ANOVA. A necessary step in this equation is to calculate the variance for each group.
h4:calculate-sums-of-squares-total-sst-for-each-of-the-factors-in-the-model. Calculate sums of squares total (SST) for each of the factors in the model.
h4:calculate-the-sums-of-squares-for-the-model-ssm-for-each-of-the-factors-in-the-model. Calculate the sums of squares for the model (SSM) for each of the factors in the model.
h4:calculate-the-sums-of-squares-residual-ssr-for-each-of-the-factors-in-the-model. Calculate the sums of squares residual (SSR) for each of the factors in the model.
