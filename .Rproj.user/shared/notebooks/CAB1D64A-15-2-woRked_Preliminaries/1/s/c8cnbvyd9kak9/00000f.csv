"1","Note. M and SD are used to represent mean and standard deviation, respectively.
Values in square brackets indicate the 95% confidence interval.
The confidence interval is a plausible range of population correlations 
that could have caused the sample correlation (Cumming, 2014).
 * indicates p < .05. ** indicates p < .01.
