description: |
  ReCentering Psych Stats is an open education resource for teaching statistics with the open-source program, R, in a socially and culturally responsive manner. The series provides workflows and worked examples in R and each statistic is accompanied by an example APA style presentation of results. A core focus of the ReCentering series is simulated data from published articles that focus on issues of social justice and are, themselves, conducted in a socially responsive manner.
