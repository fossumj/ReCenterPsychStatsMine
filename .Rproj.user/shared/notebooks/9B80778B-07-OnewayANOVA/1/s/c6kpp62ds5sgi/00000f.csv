"0","#In this script we can think ""Accurate by COND"" meaning that the descriptives for accuracy will be grouped by COND which is a categorical variable"
"0","#mat = TRUE presents the output in matrix (table) form"

"0","#data = accSIM30 is a different (I think easier) way to identify the object that holds the dataframe"

"0","#Note. Recently my students and I have been having intermittent struggles with the describeBy function in the psych package. We have noticed that it is problematic when using .rds files and when using data directly imported from Qualtrics. If you are having similar difficulties, try uploading the .csv file and making the appropriate formatting changes."
