\chapter*{PREFACE}\label{preface}}


\textbf{If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress. Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 21 Aug 2023}. Emerging volumes on other statistics are posted on the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/BikosRVT/ReCenter.html}{ReCentering Psych Stats} page at my research team's website.

\href{https://youtu.be/yy0z85Wla7o}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

To \emph{center} a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., \emph{psych}, \emph{lavaan}) used for analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub repository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license {[}CC BY-NC-SA 4.0{]}.

Training models for doctoral programs in health service psychology are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the \emph{scientist-practitioner-advocacy} training model, incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities \citep{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014}. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive?

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC{[}low-middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity,
\item
  the lesson's statistic is used in the article, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available.
\end{itemize}

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, ``A fish doesn't know that it's wet'' is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to institutional and systemic factors that contribute to discrimination as a function of race, gender, nationality, class, and so forth. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to \emph{changing the water} in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-1996), I learned that ``a foreign language'' was a graduation requirement. \emph{Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English.} This could have been met with credit from high school, but my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri's School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (FORTRAN, C++) -- but I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, ``SPSS for Windows'' would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook \citep{green_using_2017} that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (1947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine has been Dr.~Barbara Byrne's \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016}, ``Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.'' I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it. Dr.~Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr.~Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr.~Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the \href{https://www.academics4blacklives.com/}{Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative}. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics \& Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr.~Jhangiani's text \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

The creation of this OER has relied on strong peer and student support. Many thanks to Thane Erickson, PhD for being the first to pilot the resource (and approach to teaching) in his class. Students (both paid and unpaid) have served as editorial assistants in copyediting the text and correcting the text captions. Students who have held the Editorial Assistant role include Sarah Day, Ellie Smith, Tara Shelby, Keyera Gaulden, Kiana Clay, Lexa Gambrill, Ashley Righetti, and Jaylee York.

\section{What to expect in each chapter}\label{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}}

This textbook is intended as \emph{applied,} in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and \emph{writing them up} for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include \emph{hand-calculations} (using R to do the math for us) to provide a \emph{visceral feeling} of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic.

Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a \emph{workflow} through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a \emph{research vignette.} Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC {[}low middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or the data is available in a repository.
\end{itemize}

Each chapter features functions and code from \emph{R} packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science. Each worked example concludes with an \emph{APA style results section} that is intended to be used as a model or recipe that is appropriate for many empirical manuscripts. Where possible, hints are provided that will make the production of tables and figures straightforward.

The practice problems are suggestions for homework. Most chapters include suggestions for both working the problem with R and R packages as well as hand calculations. The suggestions for homework are designed to met you where you are. If you are feeling less confident about your ability (or, perhaps short on time), you can choose the easiest options (e.g., changing the random seed and reworking the problem which should be nearly identical to the worked example); with more confidence or time you might choose to work the problem with another variable; with abundant confident (or perhaps a need to do so) you might choose to your own data, data that is available to you, or simulated data from another source. Repetition and practice might mean that you do each of these options.

Finally, each lesson concludes with a \emph{homeworked example}. This section provides a streamlined working of the problem with R or R packages. When the ANOVA models become more complex, there are often a myriad of ways to approach a problem. I have tried to select one that is sensible to me. The \emph{homeworked examples} draw from a single dataset is available on the OER's \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats/blob/main/Worked_Examples/ReC.rds}{GitHub site} as well as in a \href{https://osf.io/z84kh/}{pre-registered repository} on the Open Science Framework (OSF). An explanation of this study and codebook for the variables is provided at the end of the this lesson.

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Simply follow along in your preferred format of the book (html, PDF, or ebook) and then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Locate the original documents at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{GitHub repository}. You can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open them to simply take note of the ``behind the scenes'' script
  \item
    copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
  \item
    clone a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub Desktop app} makes this easy!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
\item
  Each time the book is updated, new .docx (Microsoft Word), PDF (Adobe Acrobat), and ebook(EPUB File) versions are also createdt. You can access these in the ``docs'' folder at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{GitHub repository}.
\item
  Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
  \item
    start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
  \item
    sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.
  \item
    I am also seeking peer-review feedback at this \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OnBLfut3VIOIS2}{Qualtrics-hosted survey}. You are welcome to complete only the portions that are relevant to you.

\hypertarget{if-you-are-new-to-r}{%
\section{If You are New to R}\label{if-you-are-new-to-r}}

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. The \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/ReCenterPsychStats/Ready.html}{Ready\_Set\_R}lesson of this volume provides an introduction and the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/ReCenterPsychStats/waRmups.html}{waRming up}lesson walks through simple data preparation and descriptive statistics.

In the remaining lessons, I have attempted to provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hashtagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of tasks. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a ``scRiptuRe'' file. I take notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint. You may also find it useful to create a working document of your own tips and tricks.

\section{Introduction to the Data Set Used for Homeworked Examples}\label{introduction-to-the-data-set-used-for-homeworked-examples}}

\href{}{Screencast Link}

Each lesson concludes with streamlined example of working the primary statistic from each lesson. This section is intended to be helpful in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The worked example focuses on the operations and interpretations and more closely mimics ``how you would work a problem in real life.''
\item
  The grading rubric from the end of each lesson serves as the outline for the process.
\item
  This dataset could be used for the practice problems. For homework that you submit for grading, please choose \emph{different variables} than the ones worked in the examples.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-data-set}{%
\subsection{The Data Set}\label{the-data-set}}

The dataset used in the ``homeworked'' examples is from my own research. Along long with the pre-registration and codebooks, it is publicly available in a \href{https://osf.io/z84kh/}{pre-registered repository} on the Open Science Framework (OSF). I have also provided a copy of it in the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats/blob/main/Worked_Examples/ReC.rds}{GitHub repository} that hosts the ReCentering Psych Stats OER.

This data is from an IRB-approved study. The informed consent of the IRB specified that the data could be used in research as well as in teaching demonstrations and would be made available to the general public. You may notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are *not** the institution's identification numbers. Rather, they have been further anonymized.

The purpose of the research project was to evaluate efforts to recenter -- in a socially responsive way -- courses in the statistics and research methods sequence in scientist-practitioner psychology (PhD) programs. The recentering occurred in two phases: (a) a transition from SPSS to R and (b) an explicit recentering. Data were from end-of-course evaluations three courses I taught: Research Methods I: Analysis of Variance {[}ANOVA{]}, Research Methods III: Multivariate Modeling {[}multivariate{]}, and Research Methods IV: Psychometrics/Theory of Test Construction {[}psychometrics{]}) that were offered 2017 through 2022.

Because students could contribute up to three course evaluations, each, multilevel modeling was used for the primary analyses. The nature of the data, though, allows me to demonstrate all of the statistics utilized the OER with this data. For each analysis, I have tried to derive a sensible question that \emph{could be} answered by the data. In-so-doing, I try to point out when the alignment of research question and statistic is less than ideal.

The data file is titled \emph{ReC.rds} and can be retrieved with this code:

From these variables, I created three scales to assess valued by the student (Valued), traditional pedagogy (TradPed), and socially responsive pedagogy (SRped). I will use these in the demonstrations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Valued by the student} includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest
\item
  \textbf{Traditional pedagogy} includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation
\item
  \textbf{Socially responsive pedagogy} includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration
\end{itemize}

In the examples where the scale scores are used, I provide code for calculating the means.

Here's how to import the data:

With the goal of creating a common, system-wide approach to using the platform, this lesson was originally created for Clinical and Industrial-Organizational doctoral students who are entering the ``stats sequence.'' I hope it will be useful for others (e.g., faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and practitioners) who are also making the transition to R.

There is about 45 minutes of lecture.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Downloading/installing R's parts and pieces.
\item
  Using R-Markdown as the interface for running R analyses and saving the script.
\item
  Recognizing and adopting best practices for ``R hygiene.''
\item
  Identifying effective strategies for troubleshooting R hiccups.

\hypertarget{so-many-parts-and-pieces}{%
\subsection{So many paRts and pieces}\label{so-many-parts-and-pieces}}

Before we download R, it may be helpful to review some of R's many parts and pieces.

The base software is free and is available \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{here}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the demo, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location -- and it should be geographically ``close to you.''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  \item
    You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}{R Studio} is the way in which we operate R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system:\\
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note} If you are working on an \emph{enterprise-owned machine} (e.g,. in my specific context, if you are a faculty/staff or have a lab with institution-issued laptops) there can be complications caused by how documents are stored. In recent years we have found that letting the computer choose where to load base R, R Studio, and the packages generally works. The trick is to save R projects (i.e., folder with .rmd files and data) into the OneDrive folder that syncs to your computer. If you have difficulty knitting that is unrelated to code/script (which you can evaluate by having a classmate or colleague successfully knit on their machine), it is likely because you have saved the files to the local hard drive and not OneDrive. If you continue to have problems I recommend consulting with your computer and technology support office.

\subsection{oRienting to R Studio (focusing only on the things we will be using first and most often)}\label{orienting-to-r-studio-focusing-only-on-the-things-we-will-be-using-first-and-most-often}}

R Studio is organized around four panes. These can be re-sized and rearranged to suit your personal preferences.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upper right window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environment: lists the \emph{objects} that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lower right window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Files}: Displays the file structure in your computer's environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigate to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  \item
    \emph{Packages}: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to a specific package, you will know if it is ``on'' because its box is checked. You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the ``Help'' window.
  \item
    The \emph{Viewer} and \emph{Plots} tabs will be useful, later, in some advanced statistics when we can simultaneously examine output and script in windows that are side-by-side.
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R Studio runs in the Console (the background). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here.
  \item
    More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes up the whole screen.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{best-practices}{%
\section{best pRactices}\label{best-practices}}

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to ``skip this.'' However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting (and repeating, ad nauseum) to my students.

\hypertarget{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}{%
\subsection{Everything is documented in the .rmd file}\label{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}}

Although others do it differently, I put \emph{everything} in my .rmd file. That is, my R script includes code for importing data and opening packages. Additionally, I make notes about the choices I am making. Relatedly, I keep a ``bug log'' -- noting what worked and what did not work. I will also begin my APA style results section directly in the .rmd file.

Why do I do all this? Because when I return to my project hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

\hypertarget{setting-up-the-file}{%
\subsection{Setting up the file}\label{setting-up-the-file}}

File organization is a critical key to success. In your computing environment:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a project file folder.
\item
  Put the data file in it.
\item
  Open an R Markdown file.
\item
  Save it in the same file folder as the data.
\item
  When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a specific folder) the data can be pulled into the .rmd file without creating a working directory.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{script-in-chunks-and-everything-else-in-the-inline-text-sections}{%
\subsection{Script in chunks and everything else in the ``inline text'' sections}\label{script-in-chunks-and-everything-else-in-the-inline-text-sections}}

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is ``chunks.''

The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R. You can also hashtag comments so they won't run (but you can also write anything you want between chunks without using hashtags).

Syntax for simple formatting in the text (i.e., non-chunk) areas (e.g., using italics, making headings, bold) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

``Chunks'' start and end with with three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box. Chunks have three symbols in their upper right. Those controls will disappear (and your script will not run) if you have replaced them with double or single quotation marks or one or more of the tics are missing.

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

\hypertarget{managing-packages}{%
\subsection{Managing packages}\label{managing-packages}}

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on \emph{packages} to do much of the work. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, rstatix, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk at the beginning of the lecture. When the hashtags are removed, the script will ask R to check to see if the package is installed on your machine. If it is, installation is skipped. If it is not, R installs it. Simply remove the hashtag to run the code the first time, then hashtag them back out so R is not always re-checking.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# will install the package if not already installed}
\CommentTok{\# if(!require(psych))\{install.packages(\textquotesingle{}psych\textquotesingle{})\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To make a package operable, you need to open it. There are two primary ways to do this. The first is to use the library function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#install.packages ("psych")}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{ (psych)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The second way is to place a double colon between the package and function. This second method has become my preferred practice because it helps me remember what package goes with each function. It can also prevent R hiccups when there are identical function names and R does not know which package to use. Below is an example where I might ask for descriptives from the psych package. Because I have not yet uploaded data, I have hashtagged it out, making the command inoperable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#psych::describe(mydata)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are exceptions. One is the \emph{tidyverse} package. Some of my script uses pipes (\%\textgreater\%) and pipes require \emph{tidyverse} to be activated. This is why you will often see me call the \emph{tidyverse} package with the \emph{library()} function (as demonstrated above.)

\hypertarget{upload-the-data}{%
\subsection{Upload the data}\label{upload-the-data}}

When imported (or simulated) properly, data will appear as an object in the global environment.

In the context of this OER, I will be simulating data in each lesson for immediate use in the lesson. This makes this web-based OER more \emph{portable.} This also means that when working the problems in the chapter we do notneed to (a) write the data to a file or (b) import data from files. Because these are essential skills, I will demonstrate this process here -- starting with simulating data.

At this point, simulating data is beyond the learning goals I have established for the chapter. I do need to include the code so that we get some data. The data I am simulating is used in the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA lesson}. The data is from the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} random clinical trial.

In this simulation, I am simply creating an ID number, a condition (High, Low, Control), and a score on the dependent variable, ``Accurate.'' More information about this study is included in the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA chapter}.

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{Acc\_sim30 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(ID, COND, Accurate)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At this point, this data lives only in this .rmd file after the above code is run. Although there are numerous ways to export and import data, I have a preference for two.

\hypertarget{to-and-from-.csv-files}{%
\subsubsection{To and from .csv files}\label{to-and-from-.csv-files}}

The first is to write the data to a .csv file. In your computer's environment (outside of R), these files are easily manipulated in Excel. I think of them as being ``Excel lite'' because although Excel can operate them, they lack some of the more advanced features of an Excel spreadsheet.

In the code below, I identify the R object ``Acc\_sim30'' and give it a file name, ``to\_CSV.csv''. This file name must have the .csv extension. I also indicate that it should preserve the column names (but ignore row names; since we don't have row names).

This file will save in the same folder as wherever you are using this .rmd file.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# to write it to an outfile as a .csv}
\FunctionTok{write.table}\NormalTok{(Acc\_sim30, }\AttributeTok{file =} \StringTok{"to\_CSV.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sep =} \StringTok{","}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{col.names =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
    \AttributeTok{row.names =} \ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Importing this object back into the R environment can be accomplished with some simple code. For the sake of demonstration,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# to save the df as an .csv (think \textquotesingle{}Excel lite\textquotesingle{}) file on your}
\CommentTok{\# computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are}
\CommentTok{\# working with}
\NormalTok{from\_CSV }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"to\_CSV.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{header =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The advantage of working with .csv files is that it is then easy to inspect and manipulate them outside of the R environment. The disadvantage of .csv files is that each time they are imported they lose any formatting you may have meticulously assigned to them.

\hypertarget{to-and-from-.rds-files}{%
\subsubsection{To and from .rds files}\label{to-and-from-.rds-files}}

While it is easy enough to rerun the code (or copy it from data prep .rmd and paste it into an .rmd you are using for advanced analysis), there is a better way! Saving the data as an R object preserves all of its characteristics.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# to save the df as an .rds file on your computer; it should save in}
\CommentTok{\# the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}
\FunctionTok{saveRDS}\NormalTok{(Acc\_sim30, }\StringTok{"to\_Robject.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This file will save to your computer (and you can send it to colleagues). However, it is not easy to ``just open it'' in Excel. To open an .rds file and use it (whether you created it or it is sent to you by a colleague), use the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{from\_rds }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"to\_Robject.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you are the recipient of an R object, but want to view it as a .csv, simply import the .rds then use the above code to export it as a .csv.

\hypertarget{from-spss-files}{%
\subsubsection{From SPSS files}\label{from-spss-files}}

Your data may come to you in a variety of ways. One of the most common is SPSS. The \emph{foreign} package is popular for importing SPSS data. Below is code which would import an SPSS file \emph{if I had created one}. You'll see that this script is hashtagged out because I rarely use SPSS and do not have a handy file to demo.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# opening an SPSS file requires the foreign package which I opened}
\CommentTok{\# earlier from\_SPSS \textless{}{-} foreign::read.spss (\textquotesingle{}SPSSdata.sav\textquotesingle{},}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{quick-demonstration}{%
\section{quick demonstRation}\label{quick-demonstration}}

Let's run some simple descriptives. In the script below, I am using the \emph{psych} package. Descriptive statistics will appear for all the data in the dataframe and the output will be rounded to three spaces. Note that rather than opening the psych package with the library function, I have used the double colon convention.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Because ``ID'' is the case ID and COND is the factor (high, low, control), the only variable for which this data is sensible is ``Accurate.'' Nonetheless, this provides an example of how to apply a package's function to a dataset. As we progress through the text we will learn how to manage the data so that we get the specific output we are seeking.

\hypertarget{the-knitted-file}{%
\section{the knitted file}\label{the-knitted-file}}

One of the coolest things about R Markdown is its capacity to \emph{knit} to HTML, PPT, or WORD.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this OER, I am writing the lessons in R markdown (.rmd files), with the package \emph{bookdown} as a helper, and knitting the files to .html, .doc, .pdf, and .epub formats.
\item
  The package \emph{papaja} is designed to prepare APA manuscripts where the writing, statistics, and references are all accomplished in a single file. This process contributes to replicability and reproducibility.
\item
  More detailed instructions for knitting to these formats are provided in the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/extRas/}{extRas} mini-volume of \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/BikosRVT/ReCenter.html}{ReCentering Psych Stats}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}{%
\section{tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown}\label{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}}

Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In a given set of operations, you must run/execute each piece of code in order: every, single, time. That is, all the packages have to be in your library and activated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you open an .rmd file, you cannot just scroll down to make a boxplot. You need to run any \emph{prerequisite} script (like loading files, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  \item
    Lost? Clear your global environment (broom icon in the upper right) and start over. Fresh starts are good.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. Make unique folders for each project (even if each contains only a few files).
\item
  If you have tried what seems apparent to you and cannot solve your challenge, do not wait long before typing warnings into a search engine. Odds are, you'll get some useful hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The package isn't loaded.
  \item
    The .rmd file hasn't been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data.
  \item
    There are errors in punctuation or spelling.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer). I frequently restart and clear my output and environment so that I can better track my order of operations.
\item
  If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df)). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.
\end{itemize}

  SPSS individual and site licenses are increasingly expensive and limited; that is, Mplus, AMOS, HLM, or R tools may also be needed. As package development for R is exploding, we have tools to ``do just about anything.''
\item
  Most graduate psychology programs are scientist/practitioner in nature and include training in ``high end'' statistics. Yet, many of your employing organizations will not have SPSS. R is a free, universally accessible program, that our graduates can use anywhere.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success}{%
\section{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially while it's \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (ask, ``Is the package activated?'' ``Are the data and .rmd files in the same place?'' ``Is all the prerequisite script run?'').
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by (retrieving the original .rmd file from the GitHub repository) opening a copy of the .rmd file and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does so you can translate it for any homework assignments. My suggestions for practice are intended to be parallel to the lecture with no sneaky trix.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, and so forth.
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell \citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} taught us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get great at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are necessary, but can also be problematic. Sometimes updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term. I expect that

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    prior scripts may need to be updated or revised with package updates, and
  \item
    there will be incongruencies between base R, R Studio, and the packages.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. And square breathing. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

\href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtz5cFLQl4KOoTRizMIyRU0ioiuSM1tWg}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

The beginning of any data analysis means familiarizing yourself with the data. Among other things, this includes producing and interpreting its distributional characteristics. In this lesson we mix common R operations for formatting, preparing, and analyzing the data with foundational statistical concepts in statistics.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-1}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-1}}

There is just less than two hours of lecture. If you work through the lesson with me, I would plan for an additional three hours.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the lesson, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-1}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Determine the appropriate scale of measurement for variables and format them properly in R
\item
  Produce and interpret measures of central tendency
\item
  Analyze the distributional characteristics of data
\item
  Describe the steps in calculating a standard deviation.
\item
  Describe the steps in calculating a bivariate correlation coefficient (i.e., Pearson \emph{r}).
\item
  Create an APA Style table and results section that includes means, standard deviations, and correlations and addresses skew and kurtosis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice}}

The practice assignment at the end of the lesson is designed as a ``get (or `get back') into it'' assignment. You will essentially work through this very same lecture, using the same dataframe; you will simply use a different set of continuous variables.

\hypertarget{readings-resources}{%
\subsection{Readings \& Resources}\label{readings-resources}}

In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list.

  \item
    This is the research vignette from which I simulate data that we can use in the lesson and practice problem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-vignette}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette}}

We will use data that has been simulated data from Lui \citeyearpar{lui_racial_2020} as the research vignette. Controlling for overt discrimination, and neuroticism, Lui examined the degree to which racial microaggressions contributed to negative affect, alcohol consumption, and drinking problems in African American, Asian American, and Latinx American college students (\emph{N} = 713).

Using the means, standard deviations, correlation matrix, and group sizes (\emph{n}) I simulated the data. Although I provide some narration of what I did, process of simulation is beyond the learning goals of this lesson, so you are welcome to skip it. Simulating data within each chapter makes the lesson more ``portable.''

If you have simulated the data, you can continue using the the ``Lui\_sim\_df'' object that we created. In your own research you will likely work with a datafile stored on your computer. Although I will hashtag the code out (making it inoperable until the hashtags are removed), here is script to save the simulated data both .csv (think ``Excel lite'') and .rds (it retains all the properties we specified in R) files and then bring/import them back into R. For more complete instructions see the \protect\hyperlink{Ready}{Ready\_Set\_R} lesson.

You may have noticed a couple of things in each of these operations

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First, I named the data object to include a ``df'' (i.e., dataframe).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is a common (but not required) practice for researchers to simply use ``df'' or ``dat'' as the name of the object that holds their data. This practice has advantages (e.g., as making the re-use of code quite easy across datasets) and disadvantages (e.g., it is easy to get confused about what data is being used).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Second, when you run the code, any updating \emph{replaces} the prior object.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    While this is irrelevant today (we are saving the same data with different names), it points out the importance of creating a sensible and systematic \emph{order of operations} in your .rmd files and then knowing where you are in the process.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Because the data is simulated, I can simply use the data I created in the simulation, however, I will go ahead and use the convention of renaming it, ``df'', which (in this case) stands for \emph{dataframe} and is the common term for a dataset for users of R. \emph{A quick note: in statistics ``df'' is also an abbreviation for ``degrees of freedom.''}

\hypertarget{variable-types-scale-of-measurement}{%
\section{Variable Types (Scale of Measurement)}\label{variable-types-scale-of-measurement}}

When working with raw data, we begin by inspecting and preparing it for the planned analyses. The \emph{type} of variables we have influences what statistics we will utilize. Further, the data must be formatted as that type in order for the statistic to properly execute. Variable types (or formats) are directly connected to the statistical concept of \emph{measurement scale} (or \emph{scale of measurement}). Researchers often think of the \emph{categorical versus continuous} distinction, but it's even more nuanced than that.

\hypertarget{measurement-scale}{%
\subsection{Measurement Scale}\label{measurement-scale}}

\textbf{Categorical} variables name \emph{discrete} or \emph{distinct} entities where the categorization has no inherent value or order. When there are two categories, the variable type is \textbf{binary} (e.g., pregnant or not, treatment and control conditions). When there are more than two categories, the variable type is \textbf{nominal} (e.g., teacher, student, or parent; Republican, Democrat, or Independent).

\textbf{Ordinal} variables are also categorical variables where the score reflects a logical order or relative rank (e.g., the order of finishing in a race). A challenge with the ordinal scale is the inability to determine the distance between rankings. The percentile rank is a (sometimes surprising) example of the ordinal scale. Technically, Likert type scaling (e.g., providing ratings on a 1-to-5 scale) is ordinal because it is uncertain that the distance between each of the anchors is equal. Practically, though, most researchers treat the Likert type scale as interval. This is facilitated, in part, because most Likert-type scales have multiple items which are averaged into a single score. Navarro\citeyearpar{navarro_book_2020} uses the term, \textbf{quasi-interval} to describe Likert-type scaling.

\textbf{Continuous} variables can take on any value in the measurement scale that is being used. \textbf{Interval} level data has equal distances between each unit on the scale. Two classic examples of interval level data are temperature and year. Whether using Fahrenheit or Celsius, the rating of 0 does not mean there is an absence of temperature, rather, it is simply a number along a continuum of temperature. Another interval example is calendrical time. In longitudinal research, we frequently note the date or year (e.g., 2019) of an event. It is highly unlikely that the value zero will appear in our research and if it did, it would not represent the absence of time. A researcher can feel confident that a variable is on the interval scale if the values can be meaningfully added and subtracted.

\textbf{Ratio} level data also has equal distances between each unit on the scale, plus it has a true zero point where the zero indicates absence. Examples are behavioral counts (e.g., cigarettes smoked) and time-on-task (e.g., 90 seconds). Ratio data offers more manipulative power because researchers can add, subtract, multiply, and divide ratio level data.

\hypertarget{corresponding-variable-structure-in-r}{%
\subsection{Corresponding Variable Structure in R}\label{corresponding-variable-structure-in-r}}

With these definitions in mind, we will see if R is reading our variables correctly. R will provide the following designations of variables:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

Factor & factor & two or more categories; R imposes an alphabetical order; the user can re-specify the order based on the logic of the design & nominal \\
\end{longtable}

Looking back at the Lui \citeyearpar{lui_racial_2020} article we can determine what the scale of measurement is for each variable and what the corresponding R format for that variable should be:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 8\tabcolsep) * \real{0.0706}}

\end{longtable}

We can examine the accuracy with which R interpreted the type of data with the \emph{structure()} command.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Only Race/Ethnicity needs to be transformed from a character (``chr) variable to a factor. I will use the \emph{mutate()} function in the \emph{dplyr} package to convert the RacEth variable to be a factor with three levels.

Let's check the structure again. Below we see that the RacEth variable is now a factor. R has imposed an alphabetical order: Asian, Black, Latinx.

\section{Descriptive Statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}}

While the majority of this OER (and statistics training in general) concerns the ability to make predictions or inferences (hence \emph{inferential statistics}) from data, we almost always begin data analysis by describing it (hence, \emph{descriptive statistics}).

Our research vignette contains a number of variables. Lui \citeyearpar{lui_racial_2020} was interested in predicting negative affect, alcohol consumption, and drinking problems from overt discrimination, microaggressions, neuroticism, through psychological distress. This research model is a \emph{mediation} model (or model of indirect effects) and is beyond the learning objectives of today's instruction. In demonstrating descriptive statistics, we will focus on one of the dependent variables: negative affect.

As we begin to explore the descriptive and distributional characteristics of this variable, it may be helpful to visualize it through a histogram.

\hypertarget{measures-of-central-tendency}{%
\subsection{Measures of Central Tendency}\label{measures-of-central-tendency}}

Describing data almost always begins with \emph{measures of central tendency}: the mean, median, and mode.

\hypertarget{mean}{%
\subsubsection{Mean}\label{mean}}

The \textbf{mean} is simply a mathematical average of the non-missing data. The mathematical formula is frequently expressed this way:

\[\bar{X} = \frac{X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3}...+ X_{N}}{N}\] Because this formula is clumsy to write, there is statistical shorthand to help us convey it more efficiently (not necessarily, more easily).

Placing information below (where to start), above (where to stop), and to the right (what data to use) of the summation operator (\(\sum\)), provides information about the nature of the data. In the formula below, we learn from the notation to the right that we use the individual data in the vector X. We start with the first piece of data (\emph{i} = 1) and stop with the \emph{Nth} (or last) case.

\[\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}\] The \(\frac{1}{N}\) notation to the left tells us that we are calculating the mean.

\[\bar{X}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}\] R is an incredible tool in that we can type out mathematical operations, use functions from base R, and use packages to do the work for us. If we had the following toy dataset (2, 3, 2, 1, 5, NA) we could calculate the mean by typing it out:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{3} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2.6
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively we could use the built-in functions in base R to do the work for us. Let me add a little complexity by creating a single variable (a vector of data) and introducing a little missingness (i.e., the ``NA'').

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{toy }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{NA}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{toy }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.data.frame}\NormalTok{(toy)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I can use the base R function \emph{mean()}. Inside the parentheses I point to the data. The function automatically sums the values. When there is missingness, adding \emph{na.rm=TRUE} tells the function to exclude the missing variables from the count (i.e., the denominator would still be 5).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2.6
\end{verbatim}

In my simulation of the research vignette, we have no missing values, none-the-less, it is, perhaps a good habit to include the \emph{na.rm=TRUE} specification in our code. Because we have an entire dataframe, we just point to the dataframe and the specific variable (i.e., negative affect).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.813748
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{median}{%
\subsubsection{Median}\label{median}}

The middle value in a set of values is the \textbf{median}. The easiest way to calculate the median is to sort the numbers:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Unsorted & Sorted \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
2, 3, 2, 1, 5, & 1, 2, 2, 3, 5 \\
\end{longtable}

And select the middle value. Because we have an odd number of values (\emph{N} = 5), our median is 2. If we had an even number of values, we would take the average of the middle two numbers.

We can use a base R function to calculate the median for us. Let's do it first with the toy data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

Let's also calculate it for the negative affect variable from the research vignette.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.765367
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{mode}{%
\subsubsection{Mode}\label{mode}}

The \textbf{mode} is the score that occurs most frequently. When a histogram is available, spotting the mode is easy because it will have the tallest bar. Determining the mode can be made complicated if there are ties for high frequencies of values. A common occurrence of this happens in the \textbf{bimodal} distribution.

Unfortunately, there is no base R function that will call a mode. In response, Navarro developed and included a function in the \emph{lsr} package that accompanies her \citeyearpar{navarro_book_2020} textbook. Once the package is installed, you can include two colons, the function name, and then the dataset to retrieve the mode.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lsr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{modeOf}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

From our toy data, we the \emph{modeOf()} function returns a 2.

Let's retrieve the mode from the negative affect variable in our research vignette.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lsr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{modeOf}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1
\end{verbatim}

The value is a 1.0 and is likely an artifact of how I simulated the data. Specifically, to ensure that the values fell within the 1-to-4 range, I rounded up to 1.0 any negative values and rounded down to 4.0 any values that were higher than 4.0.

\hypertarget{relationship-between-mean-median-and-mode}{%
\subsubsection{Relationship between mean, median, and mode}\label{relationship-between-mean-median-and-mode}}

Many inferential statistics rely on manipulations of the mean. The mean, though, can be misleading when it is influenced by outliers. Therefore, as we engage in preliminary exploration, it can be quite useful to calculate all three measures of central tendency, as well as exploring other distributional characteristics.

As a bit of an advanced cognitive organizer, it may be helpful to know that in a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are the same number (or quite close). In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is higher than the median which is higher than the mode. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is lower than the median, which is lower than the mode.

\hypertarget{variability}{%
\section{Variability}\label{variability}}

Researchers are critically interested in the spread or dispersion of the scores.

\hypertarget{range}{%
\subsection{Range}\label{range}}

The \textbf{range} is the simplest assessment of variability and is calculated by identifying the highest and lowest scores and subtracting the lowest from the highest. In our toy dataset, arranged from low-to-high (1, 2, 2, 3, 5 ) we see that the low is 1 and high is 5; 4 is the range. We can retrieve this data with three base R functions that ask for the minimum score, the maximum score, or both together -- the range:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{range}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 5
\end{verbatim}

The negative affect variable from our research vignette has the following range:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 4
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{range}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 4
\end{verbatim}

With a low of 1 and high of 4, the range of negative affect is 3. This is consistent with the description of the negative affect measure.

One limitation of the range is that it is easily influenced by extreme scores.

\hypertarget{percentiles-quantiles-interquartile-range}{%
\subsection{Percentiles, Quantiles, Interquartile Range}\label{percentiles-quantiles-interquartile-range}}

The \textbf{interquartile range} is middle 50\% of data, or the scores that fall between 25th and 75th percentiles. Before calculating that, let's first define \textbf{quantiles} and \textbf{percentiles}. \textbf{Quantiles} are values that split a data into equal portions. \textbf{Percentiles} divide the data into 100 equal parts. Percentiles are commonly used in testing and assessment. You may have encountered them in standardized tests such as the SAT and GRE where both the score obtained and its associated percentile are reported. When graduate programs evaluate GRE scores, depending on their criteria and degree of competitiveness they may set a threshold based on percentiles (e.g., using a cut of of the 50th, 75th, or higher percentile for the verbal or quantitative GRE scores).

We have already learned the value of the median. The median is also the 50th percentile. We can now use the \emph{quantile()} function and indicate we want the value at the 50\% percentile.

Let's first examine the toy dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{probs =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
50% 
  2 
\end{verbatim}

As shown by our calculation, the value at the median and the 50th percentile is 2.0. Let's look at those values for the research vignette:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.765367
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{probs =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     50% 
1.765367 
\end{verbatim}

Again, we see the same result. Half of the values for negative affect are below 1.76; half are above.

The \emph{quantile()} function is extremely useful. We can retrieve the raw score at any percentile, and we could ask for as many as we desired. Here's an example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{probs =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.3}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.4}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.6}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.7}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.8}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.9}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     10%      20%      30%      40%      50%      60%      70%      80% 
1.000000 1.142097 1.376633 1.582701 1.765367 1.943260 2.143177 2.360980 
     90% 
2.682303 
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Quartiles} divide the data into four equal parts. The \textbf{interquartile range} is the spread of data between the 25th and 75th percentiles (or quartiles). We calculate the interquartile range by first obtaining those values, and then subtracting the lower from the higher.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{probs =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{0.25}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.75}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     25%      75% 
1.271045 2.240372 
\end{verbatim}

We see that a score of 1.29 is at the 25th percentile and a score of 2.24 is at the 75th percentile. If we subtract 1.29 from 2.24\ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FloatTok{2.24} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \FloatTok{1.29}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.95
\end{verbatim}

\ldots we learn that the interquartile range is 0.95. We could also obtain this value by using the \emph{IQR()} function in base R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{IQR}\NormalTok{(df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}

\end{verbatim}

You may be asking, ``When would we use the interquartile range?'' When data are influenced by \textbf{outliers} (i.e., extreme scores), using a more truncated range (the middle 50\%, 75\%, 90\%) may be an option (if the dataset it large enough). At this point, though, the goal of this lesson is simply to introduce different ways of examining the variability in a dataset. Ultimately, we are working our way to the \textbf{standard deviation}. The next logical step is the \textbf{mean deviation.}

\hypertarget{deviations-around-the-mean}{%
\subsection{Deviations around the Mean}\label{deviations-around-the-mean}}

Nearly all statistics include assessments of variability in their calculation and most are based on deviations around the mean. In fact it might be good to pause for a moment and consider as the lessons in this OER (and those that follow) continue, we will be engaged in \emph{mathematical and statistical modeling}. In a featured article in the \emph{American Psychologist}, Rodgers \citeyearpar{rodgers_epistemology_2010} described models as a representation of reality that has two features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the model describes reality in some important ways, and
\item
  the model is simpler than reality.
\end{itemize}

Albeit one of the simplest, the mean is a statistical model. Rodgers noted this when he wrote, ``The mean and variance have done yeoman service to psychology and other behavioral sciences,'' \citeyearpar[p.~4]{rodgers_epistemology_2010}. These next statistical operations will walk through the use of the mean, particularly in its role in understanding variance. In later lessons, means and variances are used in understanding relations and differences.

A first step in understanding mean deviation is to ask, ``How far does each individual score deviates from the mean of scores?'' We can demonstrate this with our toy dataset. I am taking more steps than necessary to (a) make clear how the mean deviation (abbreviated, mdev) is calculated and (b) practice using R.

First, I will create a variable representing the mean:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Dissecting the script, each variable is referenced by}
\CommentTok{\# df\_nameDOLLARSIGNvariable\_name}
\NormalTok{toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mean }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(toy)  }\CommentTok{\#displays the first 6 rows of the data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  toy mean

2   3  2.6
3   2  2.6
4   1  2.6
5   5  2.6
6  NA  2.6
\end{verbatim}

Next, I will subtract the mean from each individual score. The result

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mdev }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{toy }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mean}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(toy)  }\CommentTok{\#displays the first 6 rows of the data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  toy mean mdev
1   2  2.6 -0.6
2   3  2.6  0.4
3   2  2.6 -0.6
4   1  2.6 -1.6
5   5  2.6  2.4
6  NA  2.6   NA
\end{verbatim}

The variable, \emph{mdev} (short for ``mean deviation'') lets us know how far the individual score is from the mean. Unfortunately, it does not provide an overall estimate of variation. Further, summing and averaging these values all result in zero. Take a look:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Dissecting the script, Wrapping the sum and mean script in \textquotesingle{}round\textquotesingle{}}
\CommentTok{\# and following with the desired decimal places, provides a rounde}

\FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mdev, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mdev, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0
\end{verbatim}

One solution is to create the \emph{mean absolute deviation}. We first transform the mean deviation score to their absolute values, and then sum them.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{abslt\_m }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{abs}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mdev)}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(toy)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  toy mean mdev abslt_m
1   2  2.6 -0.6     0.6
2   3  2.6  0.4     0.4
3   2  2.6 -0.6     0.6
4   1  2.6 -1.6     1.6
5   5  2.6  2.4     2.4
6  NA  2.6   NA      NA
\end{verbatim}

And now to average them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(toy}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{abslt\_m, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.12
\end{verbatim}

This value tells how far individual observations are from the mean, ``on average.'' In our toy dataset, the average distance from the mean is 1.12.

So that we can keep statistical notation in our mind, this is the formula calculating the absolute mean deviation:

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}|X_{i} - \bar{X}|\] Let's quickly repeat the process with the negative affect variable in our research vignette. So that we can more clearly see the relationship of the new variables to negative affect, let me create a df containing only nAff:

Thus, the absolute mean deviation for the negative affect variable in our research vignette is 0.521.

Although relatively intuitive, the absolute mean deviation is not all that useful. Most statistics texts include it because it is one of the steps toward variance, and ultimately, the standard deviation.

\hypertarget{variance}{%
\subsection{Variance}\label{variance}}

Variance is considered to be an \emph{average} dispersion calculated by summing the squared deviations and dividing by the number of observations (minus 1; more on that in later lessons).

Our next step is to square the mean deviations. This value is also called the \emph{sum of squared errors}, \emph{sum of squared deviations around the mean}, or \emph{sums of squares} and is abbreviated as \emph{SS}. Below are common statistical representations:

\[SS = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \bar{X})^{^{2}}\] Let's do it with our toy data.

Thus, our \emph{SS} (sums of squares or sums of squared errors) is 9.2.

To obtain the variance we divide by \emph{N} (or \emph{N} - 1; described in later lessons). Here are the updated formulas:

\[s^{2}=\frac{SS}{N-1}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \bar{X})^{^{2}}}{N-1}\] Let's do this with the toy data:

Unfortunately, because the mean deviations were squared, this doesn't interpret well. Hence, we move to the \emph{standard deviation}.

\hypertarget{standard-deviation}{%
\subsection{Standard Deviation}\label{standard-deviation}}

The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. Stated another way, it is an estimate of the average spread of data, presented in the same metric as the data.

Calculating the standard deviation requires earlier steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculating the mean.
\item
  Calculating mean deviations by subtracting the mean from each individual score.
\item
  Squaring the mean deviations.
\item
  Summing the mean deviations to create the \emph{SS}, or sums of squares.
\item
  Dividing the \emph{SS} by \emph{N} - 1; this results in the \emph{variance} around the mean.
\end{enumerate}

The 6th step is to take the square root of variance. It is represented in the formula, below:

\[s=\sqrt{\frac{SS}{N-1}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \bar{X})^{^{2}}}{N-1}}\] Repeated below are each of the six steps for the toy data:

In APA Style we use \emph{M} and \emph{SD} as abbreviations for mean and standard deviation, respectively. In APA Style, non-Greek statistical symbols such as these are italicized. Thus we would write \emph{M} = 1.81(\emph{SD} = 0.63) in a statistical string of results.

We can examine the standard deviation in relation to its mean to understand how narrowly or broadly the data is distributed. Relative to a same-sized mean, a small standard deviation means that the mean represents the data well. A larger standard deviation, conveys that there is greater variability and the mean, alone, is a less valid representation of the score.

In later lessons we will explore the standard deviation in more detail -- learning how we can use it in the determination of the significance and magnitude of relations and differences.

\hypertarget{are-the-variables-normally-distributed}{%
\section{Are the Variables Normally Distributed?}\label{are-the-variables-normally-distributed}}

Statistics that we use are accompanied by assumptions about the nature of variables in the dataset. A common assumption is that the data are \emph{normally distributed}. That is, the data presumes a standard normal curve.

For a streamlined presentation, let me create a df with three, continuously scaled, variables of interest.

\hypertarget{skew-and-kurtosis}{%
\subsection{Skew and Kurtosis}\label{skew-and-kurtosis}}

Skew and kurtosis are indicators of non-normality. Skew refers to the degree to which the data is symmetrical. In the figure below, the symmetrical distribution in the center (the black line) has no apparent evidence of skew. In contrast, the red figure whose curve (representing a majority of observations) in the left-most part of the graph (with the tail pulling to the right) is positively skewed; the blue figure whose curve (representing a majority of cases) is in the right-most part of the graph (with the tail pulling to the left) is negatively skewed.

\includegraphics{03-Preliminaries_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-48-1.pdf} Kurtosis refers to the degree to which the distribution of data is flat or peaked. Mesokurtic distributions are considered to be closest to normal. Leptokurtic distributions are peaked and platykurtic distributions are flat. As we will learn as we progress, visual observation of data is a legitimate component in evaluating skew and kurtosis.

\includegraphics{03-Preliminaries_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-49-1.pdf} There have been numerous approaches to calculating and interpreting skew and kurtosis. Consequently, different statistics packages calculate skew and kurtosis differently. The \emph{psych} package (a go-to-for a variety of tasks) offers three different options for calculating skew and kurtosis. These are specified in the script as ``type=\#'' (i.e., 1, 2, or 3 {[}the default{]}). Revelle \citeyearpar{revelle_introduction_2021} refers readers to Joanes and Gill's \citeyearpar{joanes_comparing_1998} article for detailed information about each. A very helpful resource to understand skew, kurtosis, and its interpretation is found in chapter four (Data Preparation and Psychometrics Review) of Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} SEM text is helpful in the interpretation of skew and kurtosis. Summarizing by simulation studies for structural equation modeling (i.e., multivariate statistics that are generally characterized as large sample studies using maximum likelihood estimation), Kline suggested that \emph{type=1} skew values greater than the absolute value of 3.0 are ``severely'' skewed. Regarding \emph{type=1} kurtosis, Kline noted the literature has suggested that values from 8.0 to 20.0 have been described as severely kurtotic. As an interpretive framework, Kline suggested that absolute values greater than 10.0 are problematic and values greater than 20 are serious. He added that this rule-of-thumb errs on the conservative side.

The \emph{psych::describe} specification of ``type=1'' results in the \emph{skew index} and \emph{kurtosis index}. For simplicity sake, I will refer to this specific variation of skew and kutosis as ``type=1.'' This is a very quick way to obtain initial values.

\end{verbatim}

Using Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines for evaluation, a quick review of the type=1 output indicates that no skew value exceeded the absolute value of 3.0. That is, across the nAff, mAggr, and drProb variables the highest type=1 skew value was 0.93 Regarding kurtosis, no value had a greater magnitude then .59 and all fell below the absolute value of 10. A limitation of the type=1 output and Kline's interpretative guidelines is that the simulation studies that led to the interpretive guidelines were based on structural equation modeling. These statistics are multivariate in nature, they typically use maximum likelihood estimators, and are based on large samples.

An alternative tool for identifying distributions that are severely skewed or kurtotic is the ``skew.2SE'' and ``kurt.2SE'' output from \emph{pastecs::stat.desc}.

These values represent the type=1 skew (or kurtosis) value divided by two-times its respective standard error (i.e., the standard error of the skew or kurtosis distribution, not the \emph{se} value associated with the variable). The result is a standardized value that, on its own, indicates statistical significance. In the case of skew.2SE and kurt2SE, values of 1 (\emph{p} \textless{} .05), 1.29 (\emph{p} \textless{} .01), and 1.65 (\emph{p} \textless{} .001) represent statistically significant departures from symmetry (skew) and normal peakedness (kurtosis). Unfortunately, this tool is not without criticism.

\(skew.2SE = \frac{S-0}{2*SE_{skewness}}\) and \(kurt.2SE = \frac{S-0}{2*SE_{kurtosis}}\)

The skew.2SE and kurt.2SE values can be obtained with \emph{pastecs::stat.desc} by adding the ``norm = TRUE'' statement.

Statisticians have noted that these standardized values are quite sensitive to sample size \citep{field_discovering_2012, kline_data_2016}. In large samples even minor deviations from normality may appear as statistically significant. In contrast, small samples with lower power may be severely non-normal, but skew and kurtosis could go undetected. When sample sizes are smaller, using the 1.96 (or ``2'') criteria is acceptable in determining a significant skew or kurtosis, however, as the sample size increases, the probability of rejecting the hypothesis that skew (or kurtosis) also zero increases. Field \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} noted that in such cases it is appropriate to relax the standard and evaluate skew or kurtosis against the 1.29 (\emph{p} \textless{} .01) criteria. Further, when samples are larger than 200, it may be more appropriate to abandon the interpretation of the \emph{z}-values and, instead, examine the shape of the distribution rather than to interpret these standardized values.

Comparing the skewness and kurtosis type=1 values to the skew.2SE and kurt.2SE values, we can see the interpretive challenges.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Variable & skewness & skew.2SE & kurtosis & kurt.2SE \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
nAff & 0.575 & 3.141*** & -0.176 & -0.481 \\
mAggr & 0.926 & 5.059*** & 0.575 & 1.572** \\
drProb & 0.783 & 4.278*** & -0.168 & -0.460 \\
\end{longtable}

Values in the ``skewness'' column are concerning when they are exceed the absolute value of 3.0; none are. Values in the ``skew.2SE'' column are statistically significant at \(p < .001\) when they exceed 1.65. Here, the two approaches to interpreting skew both suggest positive skew (i.e., heavy distribution in the left with a long tail to the right), but only the ``skew.2SE'' results suggest that the degree of skewness is significant/concerning.

Regarding kurtosis, values in the ``kurtosis'' column become concerning when they exceed the absolute value of 10; none are. Values in the ``kurt.2SE'' become statistically significant when they exceed 1.0. The mAggr variable's value of 1.572 is statistically significant at \(p < .01\).

So how do we think about skewness and kurtosis in our data? First, I simulated a dataset with more than 700 cases. This far exceeds the ``large'' sample size of 200. Therefore, interpreting the type 1 skewness and kurtosis values according to Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} criteria of less than the absolute values of 3 and 10, respectively, is probably most appropriate. Further, skewness and kurtosis are only two dimensions of assessing whether or not a distribution is normally distributed. Thus, I will keep these results in mind as I examine additional metrics (especially when we look at histograms with superimposed curve).

In this OER, I will predominantly use the type=1 output from the \emph{psych::describe} package and use Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} interpretive criteria. I do think the ``skew.2SE'' and ``kurt.2SE'' metrics can be useful when sample sizes are smaller (perhaps \(N = 100\) or less) and ordinary least squares (such as used in ANOVA and regression models) statistics will be utilized. In any case, if I have significant concerns about normality, I always return to more extensive and authoritative sources to make my decisions about preparing my data for analysis.

\hypertarget{shapiro-wilk-test-of-normality}{%
\subsection{Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality}\label{shapiro-wilk-test-of-normality}}

In addition to skew and kurtosis, there are formal statistical tests that evaluate whether or not our data is statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. One of those is the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. The output we obtained from \emph{pastecs::stat.desc} included the Shapiro-Wilk test value and the associated \emph{p} value. When \(p < .05\), our data is statistically significantly different from a normal distribution.

In our simulated data, all variables were statistically significantly different than a normal distribution (\(nAff: W = 0.948, p < .001; mAggr: W = 0.913, p < .001; drProb: W = 0.900, p < .001\)).

Just because data is skewed, kurtotic, or non-normally distributed does not (necessarily) mean that we cannot use it. As we move through the lessons in this OER we will evaluate the quality of the data according to the statistical assumptions associated with the statistic we are using. Often there are tools that we can use (e.g., variations of the statistic that are robust to violations of assumptions, deleting univariate or multivariate outliers) in spite of our data characteristics.

\hypertarget{relations-between-variables}{%
\section{Relations between Variables}\label{relations-between-variables}}

Preliminary investigation of data almost always includes a report of their bivariate relations. Correlation coefficients express the magnitude of relationships on a scale ranging from -1 to +1. A correlation coefficient of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  -1.0 implies a 1:1 inverse relationship, such that for every unit of increase in variable A, there is a similar decrease in variable B,
\item
  0.0 implies no correspondence between two variables,
\item
  1.0 implies that as A increases by one unit, so does B.
\end{itemize}

Correlation coefficients are commonly represented in two formulas. In a manner that echoes the calculation of \emph{variance}, the first part of the calculation estimates the covariation (i.e., \emph{covariance}) of the two variables of interest.

\[
\mbox{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right) \left( Y_i - \bar{Y} \right)
\]

The problem is that the result is unstandardized and difficult to interpret. Therefore, the second part of the calculation of the correlation coefficient results in the standardization of the metric in the -1 to +1 scale. \[
r_{XY}  = \frac{\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)}{ \hat{\sigma}_X \ \hat{\sigma}_Y}
\] Covariation and correlation matrices are central to many of our statistics therefore, those of who teach statistics believe that it is important to take a look ``under the hood.'' From our research vignette, let's calculate the relationship between negative affect and psychological distress.

Examining the first formula, some parts should look familiar:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \((X_i - \bar{X})\): We can see that we need to subtract the mean from the first(X) variable in involved in the correlation; we saw this when we calculated \emph{mean deviations}.
\item
  \((Y_i - \bar{Y})\): We repeat the \emph{mean deviation} process for the second (Y) variable.
\end{itemize}

Let's work step-by-step through the calculation of a correlation coefficient. So that we can more easily see what we are doing with the variables, I will create a super tiny dataframe with the two variables of interest (negative affect and microaggressions):

The next part of the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right) \left( Y_i - \bar{Y} \right)\) suggests that we sum the cross-products of these mean deviations. Here we multiply the mean deviations to create the ``cross-product.''

Next, we sum the column of cross-products.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

To obtain the covariance, the next part of the formula suggests that we multiply the sum of cross-products by \(\frac{1}{N-1}\). I will do this in one step.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# I have created the object \textquotesingle{}cov\textquotesingle{} so I can use it in a calculation,}

\NormalTok{cov}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.3315944
\end{verbatim}

The covariance between negative affect and psychological distress is 0.373.

We now move to the second part of the formula to create the interpretable, standardized, correlation coefficient.

\[
r_{XY}  = \frac{\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)}{ \hat{\sigma}_X \ \hat{\sigma}_Y}
\] We will use our covariance value in the numerator. The denominator involves the multiplication of the standard deviations of X and Y. Because we have already learned how to calculate standard deviation in a step-by-step manner, I will use code to simplify that process:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cov}\SpecialCharTok{/}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(df4corr}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{nAff) }\SpecialCharTok{*} \FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(df4corr}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{mAggr))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.2395157
\end{verbatim}

Our results suggest that the relationship between negative affect and psychological distress is positive, as one increases so does the other. Is it strong? This really depends on your field of scholarship. The traditional values of .10, .30, and .50 are interpreted as small, medium, and large \citep{cohen_applied_2003}. Hence, when \emph{r} = 0.27, we can say that it is (more-or-less) medium.

Is it statistically significant? Because this is an introductory chapter, we will not calculate this in a stepwise manner, but use the \emph{cor.test()} function in base R to check our prior math and retrieve the \emph{p} value associated with the correlation coefficient.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

In a statistical string we would report the result of this Pearson correlation coefficient as: \emph{r} = 0.27 (\emph{p} \textless{} .001).

\item
  There is a small-to-moderate correlation between negative affect and drinking problems (\(r = 0.18\))
\item
  There is a small correlation between microaggressions and drinking problems (\(r = 0.09\))
\item
  All variables have a positive skew (with pile-up of scores on the lower end and tail pulling to the right); this is consistent with the values we calculated earlier
\item
  The scatterplots can provide clues to relations that are not necessarily linear.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Look at the relationship between negative affect and drinking problems. As negative affect hits around 2.75, there is a change in the relationship, such that drinking problems increase.
  \item

When the R script is shared through an open science framework, reproducibility is further enhanced \citep{stanley_reproducible_2018}.

We pass the desired df to the \emph{apaTables::apa.cor.table}. Commands allow us to specify what is included in the table and whether it should be displayed in the console or saved as a document to the project's folder.

\section{An APA Style Writeup}\label{an-apa-style-writeup}}

The statistics used in this lesson are often presented in the preliminary results portion of an empirical manuscript. Some of the results are written in text and some are presented in tables. APA Style recommends that the narration of results not duplicate what is presented in the tables. Rather, the write-up only highlights and clarifies what is presented in the table(s).

At the outset, let me note that a primary purpose of the Lui \citeyearpar{lui_racial_2020} article was to compare the relations of variables between three racial/ethic groups in the U.S. identified as Asian American, Black, and Latinx. Because we did not run separate analyses for each of the groups, my write-up does not make these distinctions. I highly recommend that you examine the write-up of results and the accompanying tables in Lui's article. The presentation is clear and efficient (i.e., it conveys maximal information in as little space as possible).

Below is an example of how I might write up these preliminary results:

\textbf{Preliminary Results}

\begin{quote}
Our sample included 713 participants who self-identified as Asian American, Black/African American, and Latinx American. Inspection of the characteristics of the three variables of interest (negative affect, microaggressions, drinking problems) indicated that all variables were positively skewed, however the values of skew and kurtosis did not exceed commonly used thressholds of concern \citep{kline_data_2016}. In contrast, Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality suggested that the distribution of all three variables were statistically significantly different than a normal distribution (\(nAff: W = 0.948, p < .001\); \(mAggr: W = 0.913, p < .001\); \(drProb: W = 0.900, p < .001\)). Means, standard deviations, and a correlation matrix are presented in Table 1. We noted that the correlation between negative affect and microaggressions was moderate \((r = 0.27)\); correlations between remaining variables were smaller.

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation (at the very top), then rework the lesson exactly as written. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.

For more information about the data used in this homeworked example, please refer to the description and codebook located at the end of the \href{ReCintro}{introduction}.

Preliminary analyses often consist of means, standard deviations, and correlations. These can be helpful in determining whether or not data are normally distribution. Correlations and pairs.panels also assess the relatedness of the variables.

If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could (a) select a different course (i.e., Multivariate or Psychometrics) and/or (b) different variables.

Recall that students (represented by the \emph{deID} variable) could contribute up to three course evaluations (i.e., ANOVA, psychometrics, multivariate) each. In many statistics, repeated observations creates dependencies that need to be accounted for statistically.

To avoid this dependency and to practice an R skill, let's first filter the data, selecting only those students who took ANOVA.

Our sample included 113 doctoral students in Clinical and Industrial-Organizational psychology (PhD) programs who were completing a statistics class focused on analysis of variance. Visual inspection of three dimensions of course evaluation (overall instructor, overall course, my contributions) combined with formal evaluation of skewness and kurtosis suggested that their distributions did not violate the assumption of univariate normality. That is, skew values all fell below the absolute value of 3 and kurtosis values all fell below the absolute value of 10 \citep{kline_data_2016}. Means, standard deviations, and a correlation matrix are presented in Table 1. All three correlations were strong and statistically significant. We noted that the correlation between the overall instructor and overall course was especially high \((r = .83, p < .001)\)

\chapter*{\texorpdfstring{\emph{t}-tests}{t-tests}}\label{t-tests}}


The lessons offered in the \emph{t}-tests section introduce \emph{inferential statistics}. In the prior chapters, our use of measures of central tendency (i.e., mean, median, mode) and variance (i.e., range, variance, standard deviation) serve to \emph{describe} a sample.

As we move into \emph{inferential} statistics we evaluate data from a sample and try to determine whether or not we can use it to draw conclusions (i.e, predict or make inferences) about a larger, defined, population.

The \emph{t}-test lessons begin with an explanation of the \emph{z}-score and progress through one sample, independent samples, and paired samples \emph{t}-tests. Each lesson is centered around a research vignette that was focused on physicians' communication with patients who were critically and terminally ill and in the intensive care unit at a hospial \citep{elliott_differences_2016}.

In addition to a conceptual presentation of of each statistic, each lesson includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a workflow that guides researchers through decision-points in each statistic,
\item
  the presentation of formulas and R code for ``hand-calculating'' each component of the formula,
\item
  script for efficiently computing the statistic with R packages,
\item
  an ``recipe'' for an APA style presentation of the results,
\item
  a discussion of \emph{power} in that particular statistic with R script for calculating sample sizes sufficient to reject the null hypothesis, if in fact, it is appropriate to do so, and
\item
  suggestions for practice that vary in degree of challenge.
\end{itemize}

Researchers and program evaluators, may wish to know if their data differs from an external standard. In today's research vignette, we will ask if the time physicians spent with their patients differed from an external benchmark. The one sample \emph{t}-test is an appropriate tool for this type of analysis. As we work toward the one sample \emph{t}-test we take some time to explore the standard normal curve and \emph{z}-scores, particularly as they related to probability.

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-2}}

There is just over one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, plan for an additional hour-and-a-half.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-2}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-2}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Convert raw scores to \emph{z}-scores (and back again).
\item
  Using the \emph{z} table, determine the probability of an occurence.
\item
  Recognize the research questions for which utilization of a one sample \emph{t}-test would be appropriate.
\item
  Narrate the steps in conducting a one-sample \emph{t}-test, beginning with testing the statistical assumptions through writing up an APA style results section.
\item
  Calculate a one-sample \emph{t}-test in R (including effect sizes).
\item
  Interpret a 95\% confidence interval around a mean difference score.
\item
  Produce an APA style results section for a one-sample \emph{t}-test .
\item
  Determine a sample size that (given a set of parameters) would likely result in a statistically significant effect, if there was one.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-1}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-1}}

The suggestions for homework vary in degree of complexity. The more complete descriptions at the end of the chapter follow these suggestions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rework the one-sample \emph{t}-test in the lesson by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  Rework the one-sample \emph{t}-test in the lesson by changing something else about the simulation. For example, if you are interested in power, consider changing the sample size.
\item
  Conduct a one sample \emph{t}-test with data to which you have access and permission to use. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{z-before-t}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{z} before \emph{t}}{z before t}}\label{z-before-t}}

\textbf{Probability density functions} are mathematical formula that specifies idealized versions of known distributions. The equations that define these distributions allow us to calculate the probability of obtaining a given score. This is a powerful tool.

As students progress through statistics, they become familiar with a variety of these distributions including the \emph{t}-distribution (commonly used in \emph{t}-tests), \emph{F}-distribution (commonly used in analysis of variance {[}ANOVA{]}), and Chi-square (\(X^2\)) distributions (used in a variety of statistics, including structural equation modeling). The \emph{z} distribution is the most well-known of these distributions.

The \emph{z} distribution is also known as the normal distribution, the bell curve, or the standard normal curve. Its mean is always 0.00 and its standard deviation is always 1.00. Regardless of the actual mean and standard deviation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  68.3\% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
\item
  95.4\% of the distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
\item
  99.7\% of the distribution falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{04-tOneSample_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf} \emph{z}-scores are transformations of raw scores, in standard deviation units. Using the following formula, so long as the mean and standard deviation are known, any set of continuously scaled scores can be transformed to a \emph{z}-scores equivalent:

\[z=\frac{X-\bar{X}}{s}\] We can rearrange the formula to find what raw score corresponds with the \emph{z}-score.

\[X = \bar{X} + z(s)\]

The properties of the \emph{z}-score and the standard normal curve allow us to make inferences about the data.

\hypertarget{simulating-a-mini-research-vignette}{%
\subsection{Simulating a Mini Research Vignette}\label{simulating-a-mini-research-vignette}}

Later in this larger section on \emph{t}-tests we introduce a research vignette that focuses on time physicians spend with patients. Because working with the \emph{z}-test requires a minimum sample size of 120 (and the research vignette has a sample size of 33), I will quickly create normally distributed sample of 200 with a mean of 10 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes per patient. This will allow us to ask some important questions of the data.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Raw Scores, \emph{z}-scores, and Proportions}{Raw Scores, z-scores, and Proportions}}\label{raw-scores-z-scores-and-proportions}}

With data in hand, let's ask, ``What is the range of time that physicians spend with patients that fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean?'' We would answer this question by applying the raw score formula (\(X = \bar{X} + z(s)\)) to +1 and -1 standard deviation.

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 11.9
\end{verbatim}

Because \(\pm 1SD\) covers 68\% of the distribution, we now know that 68\% of patients have physician visits that are between 7.9 and 11.9 minutes long.

What about \(\pm 2SDs\)? Similarly, we would apply the raw score formula, using 2 for the standard deviation.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Two standard deviations around the mean captures 94.5\% of patients; patients in this range receive between visits that range between 5.9 and 13.9 minutes.

And what about \(\pm 3SDs\)? This time we use 3 to represent the standard deviation.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 15.9
\end{verbatim}

Three standard deviations around the mean captures 99.7\% of patients; patients in this range receive between visits that range between 3.9 and 15.9 minutes.

\hypertarget{determining-probabilities}{%
\subsection{Determining Probabilities}\label{determining-probabilities}}

We can also ask questions of \textbf{probability}. For example, what is the probability that a physician spends at least 9.9 minutes with a patient? To answer this question we first calculate the \emph{z}-score associated with 9.9 minutes.

\[z=\frac{X-\bar{X}}{s}\]

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{9.9} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \FloatTok{9.9}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}  \CommentTok{\#for 9.9 minutes}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0
\end{verbatim}

We learn that 9.9 minutes (the mean of the distribution of raw scores) corresponds with 0 (the mean of the distribution of \emph{z}-scores).

Next, we examine a \href{https://www.statology.org/z-table/}{table of critical \emph{z} values} where we see that a score of 0.0 corresponds to an area (probability) of .50. The directionality of our table is such that fewer minutes spent with patients are represented on the left (the shaded portion) and more minutes spent with patients are represented on the right (the unshaded portion). Our question asks, what is the probability that a physician spends \emph{at least} 9.9 minutes with a patient (i.e., 9.9 or more minutes) means that we should use the area on the right. Thus, the probability that a physician spends \emph{at least} 9.9 minutes with a patient is 50\%. In this case it is also true that the probability that a physician spends 9.9 minutes or less is also 50\%. This 50/50 result helps make the point that the area under the curve is equal to 1.0.

\includegraphics{04-tOneSample_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf} We can also obtain the probability value with the \emph{pnorm()} function. We enter the score, the mean, and the standard deviation. As shown below, we can enter them in \emph{z} score formula or from the raw scores.

Next, let's ask a question that requires careful inspection of the asymmetry of the curve. What is the probability that a physician spends less than 5 minutes with a patient? First, we calculate the corresponding \emph{z}-score:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -2.45
\end{verbatim}

Second we locate the corresponding area under the normal curve. Examining the table of critical \emph{z}-values we see that a \emph{z}-score of -2.45 corresponds with an area of 0.0071. We can check this with the \emph{pnorm()} function:

\includegraphics{04-tOneSample_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf} There is a .7\% (that is less than 1\%) probability that physicians spend less than 5 minutes with a patient. The inverse (1 - .7) indicates that we can be 99\% confident that patients receive 5 or more minutes with the ICU physician.

What about operations at the other end of the curve? What is the probability that a patient receives less than 12 minutes with a physician? Again, we start with the calculation of the \emph{z}-score.

\begin{verbatim}

The 12 minute mark is 1.05 \emph{SD} above the mean. Checking the \emph{z} table lets us know that an area of 0.8531 corresponds with a \emph{z}-score of 1.05.

\hypertarget{percentiles}{%
\subsection{Percentiles}\label{percentiles}}

The same values that we just collected are often interpreted as percentiles. Our prior calculations taught us that a physician/patient visit that lasted 9.9 minutes (\emph{z} = 0), is ranked at the 50th percentile. That is, a 9.9 minute visit is longer than 50\% of patient/physician visits.

A visit lasting 5 minutes (\emph{z} = -2.45) is ranked at the .07th percentile. That is fewer than 1\% of patient/physician visits are shorter than 5 minutes.

Finally, a visit lasting 12 minutes (\emph{z} = 1.05) is ranked at the 85th percentile. That is, it is longer than 85\% of patient visits.

While this seems redundant, this something of a prelude to the importance of \emph{z} scores and the standard normal curve in assessment, evaluation, and psychometrics.

\hypertarget{transforming-variables-to-standard-scores}{%
\subsection{Transforming Variables to Standard Scores}\label{transforming-variables-to-standard-scores}}

At this point, we have hand-calculated each score. It is easy to transform a set of scores into a column of \emph{z}-scores:

5  6.120944 -1.88237678
6 11.793346  0.94679063
\end{verbatim}

The transformation of scores is considered to be \emph{linear}. That is, this 1:1 relationship would result in a correlation of 1.00. Further, the \emph{z}-version of the variable could be used in analyses, just as the original raw score. Choices to do this are made carefully and usually done to optimize interpretation. I will demonstrate this with set of descriptive statistics produced by the \emph{apa.cor.table()} function from the \emph{apaTables} package.

\hypertarget{the-one-sample-z-test}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The One-Sample \emph{z} test}{The One-Sample z test}}\label{the-one-sample-z-test}}

The one-sample \emph{z} test is a common entry point to hypothesis testing. Let's imagine that we have reason to believe that an optimal physician/patient interaction in the ICU is 10.5 minutes. We want to use this value as a contrast to our own data and ask if the physician/patient interactions in our ICU are statistically significantly different. To test this hypothesis, we first set up null (\(H_0\)) and alternative (\(H_A\)) hypotheses. Our null hypothesis states that the population mean for physician/patient visits is equal to 10.5; the alternative hypothesis states that it is unequal to 10.5.

As written, this question is \emph{two-tailed.} That is, the external mean could be larger or smaller, we are just curious to see if it is different.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu = 10.5 \\
H_A: & \mu \neq 10.5
\end{array}
\] Alternatively, we could ask a \emph{one-sided} question. That is, we might hypothesize that our sample mean is smaller than the external mean.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu = 10.5 \\
H_A: & \mu < 10.5
\end{array}
\] Whether the test is one- or two- sided makes a difference in the strictness with which we interpret the results and can impact whether or not the result is statistically significant. We will reject the \(H_0\) in favor of the alternative (\(H_A\)) if the resulting test statistic (a \emph{z} score) falls into the region of rejection (but that region shifts, depending on whether our test is one- or two- tailed).

Statistician, Sir Ronald Fisher, popularized 5\% as the region of rejection. Specifically, if a probability value associated with a \emph{z}-score (or similar) falls into the tails of a distribution that represent 5\%, then the \(H_0\) is rejected, in favor of the \(H_A\).

Stated another way

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{p} is the probability that the \(H_0\) is true

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{p} \textgreater{} 0.05 suggests that there is a 95\% chance or greater that the \(H_0\) is true
  \end{itemize}
\item
  1 minus the \emph{p} value is the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A statistically significant test result (\emph{p} \textless{} 0.05) means that the test hypothesis is false or should be rejected.
  \item
    A \emph{p} value greater than 0.05 means that no effect was observed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If our hypothesis is two-sided, then we can spread the 5\% across both tails of the test. Inspecting a table of \emph{z} values shows that \(\pm 1.96\) would be the region of rejection of \(H_0\). In contrast, if the hypothesis is directionless (two-tailed), \(1.64\) would serve as the boundary for the region of rejection and the corresponding \emph{z}-test would require the same sign (+ or -) as the hypothesized tail of the distribution. So long as the hypothesis is consistent with the data, a one-sided test can be more powerful, that is, there is greater probability (defined as area under the curve) for rejecting the \(H_0\), if it is should be rejected. \includegraphics{04-tOneSample_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}

The formula for a one-sample \emph{z}-test is as follows:

\[
z_{\bar{X}} =  \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{N}}
\] We have already calculated these values. But let's calculate some of them again as a reminder:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The resulting value, \(z = -4.242\) is our test value. Because this far exceeds \(\pm 1.96\) we know (from memory) that there is a statistically significant effect. Just to be certain, let's use the \emph{pnorm()} function to obtain the \emph{p} value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{pnorm}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FloatTok{4.24}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{mean =} \FloatTok{9.9}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sd =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.0000000000007746685
\end{verbatim}

Simply with these hand-calculations, we can claim that there was a statistically significant difference between the physician/patient visit times in our simulated sample data and external benchmark criteria: \(z(200) = -4.24, p < .001\).

The one sample \emph{z}-test is rarely sighted in the published literature. However, a close inspection of a table of critical \emph{t}-values, reveals that the very bottom row (i.e., when sample sizes are 120 or greater) is, in fact, the \emph{z} criteria. Thus, it is time to learn about the one sample \emph{t}-test.

\hypertarget{introducing-the-one-sample-t-test}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Introducing the One-Sample \emph{t}-test}{Introducing the One-Sample t-test}}\label{introducing-the-one-sample-t-test}}

The one-sample \emph{t}-test is used to evaluate whether the mean of a sample differs from another value that, symbolically, is represented as the population mean. Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} noted that this value is often the midpoint of set of scores, the average value of the test variable based on past research, or a test value as the chance level of performance.

\begin{figure}

\caption{An image of a row with two boxes labeled Condition A (in light blue) and the population mean (in dark blue) to which it is being compared. This represents the use of a one-sample \emph{t}-test.}
\end{figure}

This comparison is evident in the numerator of the formula for the \emph{t}-test that shows the population mean \(\mu\) being subtracted from the sample mean\(\bar{X}\).

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{N} }
\] Although this statistic is straightforward, it is quite limited. If the researcher wants to compare an outcome variable across two groups of people, they should consider the \protect\hyperlink{tIndSample}{independent samples \emph{t}-test}. If the participant wants to evaluate an outcome variable with two observations from the same group of people, they should consider the \protect\hyperlink{tPaired}{paired samples \emph{t}-test}

  Sample size/power analysis (which you should think about first, but in the context of teaching statistics, it's more pedagogically sensible, here).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-1}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-1}}

Empirically published articles where \emph{t}-tests are the primary statistic are difficult to locate. Having exhausted the psychology archives, I located this article in an interdisciplinary journal focused on palliative medicine. The research vignette for this lesson examined differences in physician's verbal and nonverbal communication with Black and White patients at the end of life \citep{elliott_differences_2016}.

Elliott and colleagues \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} were curious to know if hospital-based physicians (56\% White, 26\% Asian, 7.4\% each Black and Hispanic) engaged in verbal and nonverbal communication differently with Black and White patients. Black and White patient participants were matched on characteristics deemed important to the researchers (e.g., critically and terminally ill, prognostically similar, expressed similar treatment preferences). Interactions in the intensive care unit were audio and video recorded and then coded on dimensions of verbal and nonverbal communication.

Because each physician saw a pair of patients (i.e., one Black patient and one White patient), the researchers utilized a paired samples, or dependent \emph{t}-test. This statistical choice was consistent with the element of the research design that controlled for physician effects through matching (and one we will work in a later lesson). Below are the primary findings of the study.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

Nonverbal skill score (range 0 - 5) & 2.68(.84) & 2.93(.77) & 0.014 \\
\end{longtable}

In the research vignette Elliott et al. \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} indicated that physician/patient visits lasted between 3 minutes and 40 seconds to 20 minutes and 13 seconds. For the purpose of demonstrating the one sample \emph{t}-test, we might want to ask whether the length of patient visits in this research study were statistically significantly different than patient in the ICU or in palliative care, more broadly. Elliott et al.\citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} did not indicate a measure of central tendency (i.e., mean, mode, median) therefore, I will simulate the data by randomly generating 33 numbers with a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 2.5. I will use \emph{random selection with replacement}, which allows the same number to be selected more than once.

A warning: this particularly analysis (the whole lesson, in fact) is ``more simulated than usual'' and does not represent reality. However, this research vignette lends itself for this type of question.

With our data in hand, let's examine its structure. The variable representing physician minutes represents the ratio scale of measurement and therefore should be noted as \emph{num} (numerical) in R.

Below is code for saving the data to your computer (and then re-importing) as .csv or .rds files. I make choices about saving data based on what I wish to do with the data. If I want to manipulate the data outside of R, I will save it as a .csv file. It is easy to open .csv files in Excel. A limitation of the .csv format is that it does not save any restructuring or reformatting of variables. For this lesson, this is not an issue.

Although you do not need to save nor re-import the data for this lesson, here is code for saving the data as a .csv and then reading it back into R. I have hashtagged these out, so you will need to remove the hashtags if you wish to run any of these operations.

\begin{Shaded}

Plotting the data is best practice to any data analysis. Further, visualizing the data can help us with a conceptual notion of the statistic we are utilizing. The \emph{ggpubr} package is one of my go-to-tools for quick and easy plots of data. Below, I have plotted the time-with-patient (Physician Seconds) variable and added the mean. As with most plotting packages, ggpubr will ``bin'' (or cluster) the data for plotting; this is especially true for data with a large number of units (a range from 220 to 1213 is quite large). The ``rug = TRUE'' command added a lower row of the table to identify where each of the datapoint follows.

Although the histogram is not perfectly normal, we can see at least the suggestion of a normal distribution. With only a sample of 33, I'm encouraged.

Another view of our data is with a boxplot. The box captures the middle 50\% of data with the horizontal bar at the median. The whiskers extend three standard deviations around the mean with dots beyond the whiskers representing outliers. I personally like the \emph{add=``jitter''} statement because it shows where each case falls.

\subsection{Stating the Hypothesis}\label{stating-the-hypothesis}}

A quick scan of the literature suggests that health care workers' visits to patients in the ICU are typically quite brief. Specifically, the average duration of a physician visit in a 2018 study was 73.5 seconds or 1.23 minutes \citep{butler_estimating_2018}. A one-sample \emph{t}-test is appropriate for comparing the visit lengths from our sample to this external metric.

As noted in the symbolic presentation below, our null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) states that our data will be equal to the test value of 1.23 minutes. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) states that these values will not be equal.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Calculating the \emph{t}-test}{Calculating the t-test}}\label{calculating-the-t-test}}

In learning the statistic, hand-calculations can help understand what the statistic is doing. Here's the formula again:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{N} }
\]

The numerator of the formula below subtracts the test value from the sample mean. The denominator involves multiplying the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. The descriptive statistics provided the values we need to complete the analysis:

\hypertarget{statistical-significance}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Significance}\label{statistical-significance}}

If we ask about \emph{statistical significance} then we are engaged in \emph{null hypothesis significance testing} (NHST). In the case of a one sample test, we construct our hypothesis with a null and an alternative that are relatively straightforward. Specifically, we are interested in knowing if our sample mean (10.01) is statistically, significantly different from the test value of 1.23. We can write the hypotheses in this way:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu = 1.23 \\
H_A: & \mu \neq 1.23
\end{array}
\] In two parts, our null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) states that the population mean (\(H_0\)) for physician visits with palliative care patients is 1.23; the alternative \(\mu \neq\) states that it is not 1.23.

When we calculated the \emph{t}-test, we obtained a \emph{t} value. We can check the statistical significance by determining the test critical value from a \href{https://www.statology.org/t-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} for the \emph{t} distribution. There are many freely available on the internet. If our \emph{t} value exceeds the value(s) in the table of critical values, then we can claim that our sample mean is statistically significantly different from the hypothesized value.

Heading to the table of critical values we do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the one-sample \emph{t}-test, the degrees of freedom (DF) is equal to \emph{N} - 1 (32). The closest value in our table is 30, so we will use that row.
\item
  A priorily, we did not specify if we thought the difference would be greater, or lower. Therefore, we will use a column that indicates \emph{two-tails}.
\item
  A \emph{p} value of .05 is customary (but it will be split between two tails).
\item
  Thus, if our \emph{t}-value is lower than -2.042 or higher than 2.042 we know we have a statistically significant difference.
\end{itemize}

In our case, the \emph{t} value of 18.68 far exceeded the test critical value of 2.042. We would write the statistical string this way: \emph{t}(32) = 18.68, \emph{p} \textless{} .05.

In base R, the \emph{qt()} function will look up a test critical value. For the one-sample \emph{t}-test, degrees of freedom (df) is equal to \(N-1\). We ``divide the \emph{p} value by 2'' when we want a two-tailed test. Finally, the ``lower.tail'' command results in positive or negative values in the tail.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{qt}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{p =} \FloatTok{0.05}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{df =} \DecValTok{32}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{lower.tail =} \ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2.036933
\end{verbatim}

Not surprisingly, this value is quite similar to the value we saw in the table. The \emph{qt()} function is more accurate because it used df = 32 (not rounded down to 30).

\hypertarget{confidence-intervals}{%
\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}}

How confident are we in our result? With the one sample \emph{t}-test, it is common to report an interval in which we are 95\% confident that that our sample mean exists. Below is the formula, which involves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\bar{X}\) is the sample mean; in our case this is 10.01
\item
  \(t_{cv}\) the test critical value for a two-tailed model (even if the hypothesis was one-tailed) where \(\alpha = .05\) and the degrees of freedom are \(N-1\)
\item
  \(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\) was the denominator of the test statistic it involves the standard deviation of our sample (2.7) and the square root of our sample size (33)
\end{itemize}

\[\bar{X} \pm t_{cv}(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})\] Let's calculate it:

First, let's calculate the proper \emph{t} critical value. Even though these are identical to the one above, I am including them again. Why? Because if the original hypothesis had been one-tailed, we would need to calculate a two-tailed confidence interval; this is a placeholder to remind us.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Using the values from above, we can specify both the lower and upper bound of our confidence interval.

The resulting interval is the 95\% confidence interval around our sample mean. Stated another way, we are 95\% certain that the true mean of time with patients in our sample ranges between 9.05 and 10.97 minutes.

\hypertarget{effect-size}{%
\subsubsection{Effect size}\label{effect-size}}

If you have heard someone say something like, ``I see there is statistical significance, but is the difference \emph{clinically significant},'' the person is probably asking about \emph{effect sizes.} Effect sizes provide an indication of the magnitude of the difference.

The \emph{d} statistic is commonly used with \emph{t}-tests; \emph{d} assesses the degree that the mean on the test variable differs from the test value. Conveniently, \emph{d} represents standard deviation units. A \emph{d} value of 0 indicates that the mean of the sample equals the mean of the test value. As \emph{d} moves away from 0 (in either direction), we can interpret the effect size to be stronger. Conventionally, the absolute values of .2, .5, and .8, represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectfully.

Calculating the \emph{d} statistic is easy. Here are two equivalent formulas:

\[d = \frac{Mean Difference}{SD}=\frac{t}{\sqrt{N}}\]

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

The value of 3.25 indicates that the test value is approximately more than three standard deviations away from the sample mean. This is a very large difference.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions}{%
\subsection{Evaluating the Statistical Assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions}}

Let's rework the problem in R. We start at the top of the flowchart, evaluating the statistical assumptions.

\includegraphics{images/ttests/OneSampleAssmptns.jpg} All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. The one-sample \emph{t}-test has three.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The scores on the test variable as independent of each other. This is a research design issue and the one-sample \emph{t}-test is not robust to violating this assumption.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If physicians were contributing more than one data point, this vignette potentially violated this assumption. For the sake of simplicity, let's presume that each physician contributed visit length (minutes) for only one patient. If the research scenario was such that physicians contributed multiple datapoints a potential analytic choice that is robust to such a violation is \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/MultilevelModeling/}{multilevel modeling}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The test variable should be continuously scaled. This is also a matter of research design and no statistical analysis is required.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our test variable is measured in minutes; this is continuously scaled and has the properties of \emph{ratio}-level data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The test variable is normally distributed. We can check this several ways:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    visually with histograms (perhaps with superimposed curves) and boxplots,
  \item
    calculation of skew and kurtosis values,
  \item
    calculation of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{is-the-test-variable-normally-distributed}{%
\subsubsection{Is the Test Variable Normally Distributed?}\label{is-the-test-variable-normally-distributed}}

Thus, we need only to assess whether the test variable is normally distributed. The \emph{pastecs::stat.desc()} function will provide all of this information in one test. We need only add the specification, ``norm=TRUE''.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Recall from the lesson on \protect\hyperlink{preliminaries}{Preliminary Results} that there are multiple ways to assess severity of skew and kurtosis. Values greater than the absolute value of 3.0 are concerning for the ``skewness'' output. The PhysMins skewness values of 0.36 is well below that threshold. Values greater than the absolute value of 10 are concerning for the ``kurtosis'' output. The PhysMins skewness value of 0.035 is well below that thresshold. The ``skew.2SE'' and ``kurt.2SE'' values are standardized. The ``2'' in the ``skew.2SE'' is a helpful reminder that, in smaller sample sizes'', using the 1.96 (or ``2'') criteria is acceptable in determining problematic skew or kurtosis. The PhysMins values of 0.44 and 0.022 fall well below those areas of concern.

Regarding a formal assessment of normality, the \emph{pastecs::stat.descr()} output includes the Shapiro-Wilk value (normtest.W) and statistical significance (normtest.p). Non-significant results indicate that the distribution of the PhysMins variable is not statistically significantly different from a normal distribution. In the case of PhysMins, \(W = 0.977, p = 0.682\).

Considering skewness, kurtosis, and normality estimates together, we are confident that we have not violated the assumption of normality.

\hypertarget{computing-the-t-test}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Computing the \emph{t}-test}{Computing the t-test}}\label{computing-the-t-test}}

Now we are ready to calculate the \emph{t}-test, itself.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/OneSampleT.jpg}
\caption{The workflow for the one sample \emph{t}-test highlighting the evaluation of assumptions section}
\end{figure}

Calculating a one sample \emph{t}-test is possible through base R and a number of packages. Kassambara's \citeyearpar{kassambara_pipe-friendly_nodate} \emph{rstatix} package is one we can use for the \emph{t}-test and ANOVA problems that we will work. I like it for several reasons. First, it was designed to be ``pipe-friendly'' in a manner that is consistent with the \emph{tidyverse} approach to working in R and there are numerous tutorials. Additionally, \emph{rstatix} objects work well with \emph{ggpubr}, one of my favorite packages for graphing data and results.

In the script below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the first element points to the dataframe
\item
  the second element provides a ``formula''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we are predicting ``PhysMins'' from ``1'' which represent an invariant/constant hypothesized mean
  \end{itemize}
\item
  the third element identifies the population/comparison mean
\item
  specifying ``detailed = TRUE'' will produce the 95\% confidence interval around the mean (i.e., in this case the average amount of time that physicians in our sample spent with their patients)
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rstatix}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{t\_test}\NormalTok{(dfOneSample, PhysMins }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{mu =} \FloatTok{1.23}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{detailed =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

# i 2 more variables: method <chr>, alternative <chr>
\end{verbatim}

The results we obtained are identical to those we hand-calculated. The \emph{rstatix} output also includes confidence intervals. In the case of the one-sample \emph{t}-test, this represent the 95\% confidence interval around the mean. That is, we are 95\% confident that the true mean of the minutes that physicians in our sample spent with patients falls between 9.05 and 10.97. I appreciate that the \emph{rstatix} output reminds us that we are using a \emph{t}-test and that it is a two-sided hypothesis.

Knowing what the confidence interval is ``around'' can be tricky. Whatever the ``topic'' of the confidence interval will be exactly in the middle of (most) confidence intervals. We can check ourselves by adding the two ends of the confidence interval and dividing by two.

With a separate command, we can use the \emph{rstatix} package to obtain the effect size, \emph{d}. With the exception of including the ``ref.group = NULL'' statement, the script is quite similar.

\hypertarget{apa-style-results}{%
\section{APA Style Results}\label{apa-style-results}}

Let's write up the results. In-so-doing, I would include the boxplot we produced during our initial exploration of the data.

\begin{quote}
Preliminary inspection of the data indicated that we did not violate the assumption of normality. Specifically, our skew (0.36) and kurtosis (0.035) values fell below that absolute values (3.0, 10.0, respectively) that are concerning \citep{kline_data_2016}. Further, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality suggested that the distribution of our sample data did not differ significantly from a normal distribution \((W = 0.977, p = 0.682)\)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A one-sample \emph{t}-test was used to evaluate whether average amount of time that a sample of physicians (palliative care physicians in the ICU) enrolled in a research study on patient communication was statistically significantly different from the amount of time that ICU physicians spend with their patients, in general. The sample mean 10.008 (\emph{SD} = 2.7016) was significantly different from 1.23, \(t(32) = 18.672, p < .001., CI95(9.05, 10.97), d = 3.25\). The effect size, (\emph{d}) indicates a very large effect. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of time physicians in the research study spent with their patients. The results support the conclusion that physicians in the research study spent more time with their patients than ICU physicians in general.

Reflecting on these results, I must remind readers that this simulated data that is even further extrapolated. Although ``data'' informed both the amount of time spent by the physicians in the research study and data used as the test value, there are probably many reasons that the test value was not a good choice. For example, even though both contexts were ICU, palliative physicians may have a different standard of care than ICU physicians ``in general.''

\hypertarget{power-in-one-sample-t-tests}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Power in One-Sample \emph{t}-tests}{Power in One-Sample t-tests}}\label{power-in-one-sample-t-tests}}

Researchers often use power analysis packages to estimate the sample size needed to detect a statistically significant effect, if, in fact, there is one. Utilized another way, these tools allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. If the probability is unacceptably low, we may want to revise or stop. A helpful overview of power as well as guidelines for how to use the \emph{pwr} package can be found at a \href{https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{Quick-R website} \citep{kabacoff_power_2017}.

In Champely's \emph{pwr} package, we can conduct a power analysis for a variety of designs, including the one sample \emph{t}-test that we worked in this lesson. There are a number of interrelating elements of power:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample size, \emph{n} refers to the number of observations; our vignette had 33
\item
  \emph{d} refers to the difference between means divided by the pooled standard deviation; ours was (10.01-1.23)/2.7; we can use the results from Cohen's \emph{d}.
\item
  \emph{power} refers to the power of a statistical test; conventionally it is set at .80
\item
  \emph{sig.level} refers to our desired alpha level; conventionally it is set at .05
\item
  \emph{type} indicates the type of test we ran; this was ``one.sample''
\item
  \emph{alternative} refers to whether the hypothesis is non-directional/two-tailed (``two.sided'') or directional/one-tailed(``less'' or ``greater'')
\end{itemize}

In this script, we must specify \emph{all-but-one} parameter; the remaining parameter must be defined as NULL. R will calculate the value for the missing parameter.

When we conduct a ``power analysis'' (i.e., the likelihood of a hypothesis test detecting an effect if there is one), we specify, ``power=NULL''. Using the data from our results, we learn from this first run, that our statistical power was 1.00. That is, given the value of the mean difference relative to the pooled standard deviation we had a 100\% chance of detecting a statistically significant effect if there was one.

In this case our difference between the sample data and the external data is so huge, that a sample of three still nets a statistically significant result. This is unusual. Here's the \emph{t} string: \(t(2) = 9.379, p = 0.011, d = 5.415, CI95[5.78, 13.492]\).

\hypertarget{practice-problems-2}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-2}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Using R packages, complete a one-sample \emph{t}-test.

Additionally, please complete at least one set of \emph{hand calculations}, that is using the code demonstrated in the chapter to work through the formulas that compute the one-sample \emph{t}-test. At this stage in your learning, you may ignore any missingness in your dataset by excluding all rows with missing data in your variables of interest.

\subsection{Problem \#1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed}\label{problem-1-rework-the-research-vignette-as-demonstrated-but-change-the-random-seed}}

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation of the research vignette, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data but the results will likely be very similar. That said, don't be alarmed if what was non-significant in my working of the problem becomes significant. Our selection of \emph{p} \textless{} .05 (and the corresponding 95\% confidence interval) means that 5\% of the time there could be a difference in statistical significance.

\subsection{Problem \#2: Rework the research vignette, but change something about the simulation}\label{problem-2-rework-the-research-vignette-but-change-something-about-the-simulation}}

Rework the one sample \emph{t}-test in the lesson by changing something else about the simulation. Perhaps estimate another comparative number. The 1.23 was a dramatic difference from the mean of the research participants. Perhaps suggest (and, ideally, support with a reference) a different value. Alternatively, if you are interested in issues of power, specify a different sample size.

The skew value is -9.84 and far exceeds the absolute value of 3. The skew.2SE is -2.164 (larger than the absolute value of 2.0) is consistent. Thus, we might have some concern about skew.

The kurtosis value is -7.410 and is below the absolute value of 10. The kurt.2SE value is -8.212 which is substantially larger than the absolute value of 2.0. Thus, we are similarly concerned about kurtosis.

The Shapiro Wilk test value is 7.728 (\emph{p} \textless{} 0.001). This significant value suggests a distribution that is not normally distributed.

We can begin to create our \emph{t} string:

\(t(112) = -2.246, p = 0.027, CI95(3.997, 4.374)\)

Let's interpret the results. With 112 degrees of freedom, our \emph{t} value is -2.245. Because the \emph{p} value is less than .05, this is statistically significant. This means that my course evaluations in ANOVA were statistically significantly lower than the average for CPY. We are 95\% confident that the true course evaluation mean (for my courses) fell between 3.997 and 4.374.

Let's calculate the effect size. We will use a Cohen's \emph{d} which is interpreted in standard deviation units.

Cohen's \emph{d} was 0.211. This is a small effect. We can add it to the \emph{t} string.

\(t(112) = -2.246, p = 0.027, CI95(3.997, 4.374), d = -0.211\)

A one-sample \emph{t}-test was used to evaluate whether the \emph{overall instructor} course evaluation ratings from the ANOVA courses were statistically significant different from the departmental averages for the Clinical (CPY; \emph{M} = 4.4) department. The sample mean for the ANOVA course evaluations was 4.186 (\emph{SD} = 1.013). Although this mean was statistically significantly different from the average CPY course evaluation ratings of the same item, \(t(112) = -2.246, p = 0.027, CI95(3.997, 4.374)\), the effect size was quite small \((d = -0.211)\).

Researchers may wish to know if there are differences on a given outcome variable as a result of a dichotomous grouping variable. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, my research team asked if there were differences in the percentage of time that individuals wore facemasks as a result of 2020 Presidential voting trends (Republican or Democratic) of their county of residence. In these simple designs, the independent samples \emph{t}-test could be used to test the researchers' hypotheses.

There is just less than one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, plan for an additional hour

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{introducing-the-independent-samples-t-test}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Introducing the Independent Samples \emph{t}-Test}{Introducing the Independent Samples t-Test}}\label{introducing-the-independent-samples-t-test}}

The independent samples \emph{t}-test assesses whether the population mean of the test variable for one group differs from the population mean of the test variable for a second group. This \emph{t}-test can only accommodate two levels of a grouping variable (e.g., teachers/students, volunteers/employees, treatment/control) and the participants must be different in each group.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/conditions_paired.jpg}
\caption{An image of a row with two boxes labeled Condition A (in light blue) and Condition B (in dark blue). This represents the use of an independent samples \emph{t}-test to compare across conditions.}
\end{figure}

The comparison of two means is especially evident in the numerator of the formula. In the denominator we can see that the mean difference is adjusted by the standard error. At the outset, you should know that the formula in the denominator gets messy, but the formula, alone, provides an important conceptual map.

\[t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\mbox{SE}}\] If the researcher is interested in comparing the same participants' experiences across time or in different groups, they should consider using a \protect\hyperlink{tPaired}{paired samples \emph{t}-test}. Further, the independent samples \emph{t}-test is limited to a grouping variable with only two levels. If the researcher is interested in three or more levels, they should consider using a \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA}.

\hypertarget{workflow-for-independent-samples-t-test}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workflow for Independent Samples \emph{t}-Test}{Workflow for Independent Samples t-Test}}\label{workflow-for-independent-samples-t-test}}

The following is a proposed workflow for conducting a independent samples \emph{t}-test.

\includegraphics{images/ttests/IndSampleWrkFlw.jpg} If the data meets the assumptions associated with the research design (e.g., independence of observations and a continuously scaled metric), these are the steps for the analysis of an independent samples \emph{t}-test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prepare (upload) data.
\item
  Explore data with

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    graphs
  \item
    descriptive statistics
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Assess normality via skew, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
\item
  Consider the homogeneity of variance assumption and decide whether to use the Student's or Welch's formulation.
\item
  Compute the independent samples \emph{t}-test
\item
  Compute an effect size (frequently the \emph{d} or \emph{eta} statistic)
\item
  Manage Type I error
\item
  Sample size/power analysis (which you should think about first, but in the context of teaching statistics, it's more pedagogically sensible, here).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-2}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-2}}

Empirically published articles where \emph{t}-tests are the primary statistic are difficult to locate. Having exhausted the psychology archives, I located this article in an interdisciplinary journal focused on palliative medicine. The research vignette for this lesson examined differences in physician's verbal and nonverbal communication with Black and White patients at the end of life \citep{elliott_differences_2016}.

Elliott and colleagues \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} were curious to know if hospital-based physicians (56\% White, 26\% Asian, 7.4\% each Black and Hispanic) engaged in verbal and nonverbal communication differently with Black and White patients. Black and White patient participants were matched on characteristics deemed important to the researchers (e.g., critically and terminally ill, prognostically similar, expressed similar treatment preferences). Interactions in the intensive care unit were audio and video recorded and then coded on dimensions of verbal and nonverbal communication.

Because each physician saw a pair of patients (i.e., one Black patient and one White patient), the researchers utilized a paired samples, or dependent \emph{t}-test. This statistical choice was consistent with the element of the research design that controlled for physician effects through matching. Below are the primary findings of the study.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
& Black Patients & White Patients & \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Category & \emph{Mean}(\emph{SD}) & \emph{Mean}(\emph{SD}) & \emph{p}-value \\
Verbal skill score (range 0 - 27) & 8.37(3.36) & 8.41(3.21) & 0.958 \\
Nonverbal skill score (range 0 - 5) & 2.68(.84) & 2.93(.77) & 0.014 \\
\end{longtable}

Although their design was more sophisticated (and, therefore, required the paired samples \emph{t}-test), Elliott et al. \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} could have simply compared the outcome variables (e.g., verbal and nonverbal communication) as a function of their dichotomous variable, patient race (Black, White).

\hypertarget{data-simulation-1}{%
\subsection{Data Simulation}\label{data-simulation-1}}

In the data below, I have simulated the verbal and non-verbal communication variables using the means and standard deviations listed in the article. Further, I truncated them to fit within the assigned range. I created 33 sets each and assigned them to the Black or White level of the grouping variable.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

With our data in hand, let's inspect its structure (i.e., the measurement scales for the variables) to see if they are appropriate.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(dfIndSamples)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   66 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID         : Factor w/ 66 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ PatientRace: chr  "Black" "Black" "Black" "Black" ...
 $ Verbal     : num  2.76 5.73 6.81 8.68 9.1 ...
 $ Nonverbal  : num  3.41 4.02 1.62 2.52 2.11 ...
\end{verbatim}

The verbal and nonverbal variables are quasi-interval scale variables. Therefore, the numerical scale is correctly assigned by R. In contrast, patient race is a nominal variable and should be a factor. In their article, Elliot et al. \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} assigned Black as the baseline variable and White as the comparison variable. Because R orders factors alphabetically, and ``Black'' precedes ``White'', this would happen automatically. Because creating ordered factors is a useful skill, I will write out the full code.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dfIndSamples}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{PatientRace }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(dfIndSamples}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{PatientRace, }\AttributeTok{levels =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Black"}\NormalTok{,}
    \StringTok{"White"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's again check the formatting of the variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(dfIndSamples)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   66 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID         : Factor w/ 66 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ PatientRace: Factor w/ 2 levels "Black","White": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Verbal     : num  2.76 5.73 6.81 8.68 9.1 ...
 $ Nonverbal  : num  3.41 4.02 1.62 2.52 2.11 ...
\end{verbatim}

The four variables of interest are now correctly formatted as \emph{num} and \emph{factor}.

Below is code for saving (and then importing) the data in .csv or .rds files. I make choices about saving data based on what I wish to do with the data. If I want to manipulate the data outside of R, I will save it as a .csv file. It is easy to open .csv files in Excel. A limitation of the .csv format is that it does not save any restructuring or reformatting of variables. For this lesson, this is not an issue.

Here is code for saving the data as a .csv and then reading it back into R. I have hashtagged these out, so you will need to remove the hashtags if you wish to run any of these operations. If you have simulated the data (above), you do not need to save and then re-import the data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# writing the simulated data as a .csv write.table(dfIndSamples, file}
\CommentTok{\# = \textquotesingle{}dfIndSamples.csv\textquotesingle{}, sep = \textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)}
\CommentTok{\# at this point you could clear your environment and then bring the}
\CommentTok{\# data back in as a .csv reading the data back in as a .csv file}
\CommentTok{\# dfIndSamples\textless{}{-} read.csv (\textquotesingle{}dfIndSamples.csv\textquotesingle{}, header = TRUE)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The .rds form of saving variables preserves any formatting (e.g., creating ordered factors) of the data. A limitation is that these files are not easily opened in Excel. Here is the hashtagged code (remove hashtags if you wish to do this) for writing (and then reading) this data as an .rds file.

\subsection{Quick Peek at the Data}\label{quick-peek-at-the-data-1}}

Plotting the data is a helpful early step in any data analysis. Further, visualizing the data can help us with a conceptual notion of the statistic we are utilizing. The \emph{ggpubr} package is one of my go-to-tools for quick and easy plots of data. Boxplots are terrific for data that is grouped. A helpful \href{https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/}{tutorial} for boxplots (and related plots) can be found at datanovia.

In the code below I introduced the colors by identifying the grouping variable and assigning colors. Those color codes are the ``Hex'' codes you find in the custom color palette in your word processing program.

I am also fond of plotting each case with the command, \emph{add = ``jitter''}. To increase your comfort and confidence in creating figures (and with other tools) try deleting and adding back in different commands. This is how to distinguish between the essential and the elective elements of the code.

\subsection{Stating the Hypothesis}\label{stating-the-hypothesis-1}}

In this lesson, I will focus on differences in the verbal communication variable. Specifically, I hypothesize that physician verbal communication scores for Black and White patients will differ. In the hypotheses below, the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) states that the two means are equal; the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) states that the two means are not equal.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu_1 = \mu_2  \\
H_A: & \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
\end{array}
\]

\hypertarget{calculating-the-t-test-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Calculating the \emph{t}-Test}{Calculating the t-Test}}\label{calculating-the-t-test-1}}

Earlier I presented a formula for the independent samples \emph{t}-test.

\[t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\mbox{SE}}\] There are actually two formulations of the \emph{t}-test. Student's version can be used when there is no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption; Welch's can be used when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated. For the hand-calculation demonstration, I will only demonstrate the formula in the most ideal of circumstances, that is: there is no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption and sample sizes are equal.

Even so, while the formula seems straightforward enough, calculating the SE in the denominator gets a little spicy:

\[t = \frac{\bar{X_{1}} -\bar{X_{2}}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{N_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{N_{2}}}}\] Let's first calculate the SE -- the value of the denominator. For this, we need the standard deviations for the dependent variable (verbal) for both levels of patient race. We obtained these earlier when we used the \emph{describeBy()} function in the \emph{psych} package.

The standard deviation of the verbal variable for the levels in the patient race group were 2.99 for Black patients and 3.20 for White patients; the \emph{N} in both our groups is 33. We can do the denominator math right in an R chunk:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.7621627
\end{verbatim}

Our \emph{SE} = 0.762

With the simplification of the denominator, we can easily calculate the independent sample \emph{t}-test.

\[t = \frac{\bar{X_{1}} -\bar{X_{2}}}{SE}\]

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Hopefully, this hand-calculation provided an indication of how the means, standard deviation, and sample sizes contribute to the estimate of this \emph{t}-test value. Now we ask, ``But it is statistically significant?''

\hypertarget{statistical-significance-1}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Significance}\label{statistical-significance-1}}

The question of statistical significance testing invokes NHST (null hypothesis significance testing). In the case of the independent samples \emph{t}-test, the null hypothesis is that the two means are equal; the alternative is that they are not equal. Our test is of the null hypothesis. When the probability (\emph{p}) is less than the value we specify (usually .05), we are 95\% certain that the two means are not equal. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis (the one we tested) in favor of the alternative (that the means are not equal).

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu_1 = \mu_2  \\
H_A: & \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
\end{array}
\] Although still used, NHST has its critiques. Among the critiques are the layers of logic and confusing language as we interpret the results.

Our \emph{t}-value was -1.675. We compare this value to the test critical value in a table of \emph{t} critical values. In-so-doing we must know our degrees of freedom. In the test that involves two levels of a grouping value, we will use \(N -1\) as the value for degrees of freedom. We must also specify the \emph{p} value (in our case .05) and whether-or-not our hypothesis is unidirectional or bi-directional. Our question only asked, ``Are the verbal communication levels different?'' In this case, the test is two-tailed, or bi-directional.

Let's return to the \href{https://www.statology.org/t-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} for the \emph{t} distribution to compare our \emph{t}-value (-1.675) to the column that is appropriate for our:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Degrees of freedom (in this case \(N-2\) or 64)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We have two levels of a grouping value; for each our df is \(N-1\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alpha, as represented by \(p < .05\)
\item
  Specification as a one-tailed or two-tailed test

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our alternative hypothesis made no prediction about the direction of the difference; therefore we will use a two-tailed test
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the above linked table of critical values, when the degrees of freedom reaches 30, there larger intervals. We will use the row representing degrees of freedom of 60. If our \emph{t}-test value is lower than an absolute value of -2 or greater than the absolute value of 2, then our means are statistically significantly different from each other. In our case, we have not achieved statistical significance and we cannot say that the means are different. The \emph{t} string would look like this: \(t(64) = -1.675, p > .05\)

We can also use the \emph{qt()} function in base R. In the script below, I have indicated an alpha of .05. The ``2'' that follows indicates I want a two-tailed test. The 64 represents my degrees of freedom (\(N-2\)). In a two-tailed test, the regions of rejection will be below the lowerbound (lower.tail=TRUE) and above the upperbound (lower.tail=FALSE).

Given the large intervals, it makes sense that this test critical value is slightly different than the one from the table.

\hypertarget{confidence-intervals-1}{%
\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals-1}}

How confident are we in our result? With independent samples \emph{t}-tests, it is common to report an interval in which we are 95\% confident that our true mean difference exists. Below is the formula, which involves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\bar{X_{1}}-\bar{X_{2}}\) the difference in the means
\item
  \(t_{cv}\) the test critical value for a two-tailed model (even if the hypothesis was one-tailed) where \(\alpha = .05\) and the degrees of freedom are \(N-2\)
\item
  \(SE\) the standard error used in the denominator of the test statistic
\end{itemize}

\[(\bar{X_{1}} -\bar{X_{2})} \pm  t_{cv}(SE)\] Let's calculate it:

First, let's get the proper \emph{t} critical value. Even though these are identical to the one above, I am including them again. Why? Because if the original hypothesis had been one-tailed, we would need to calculate a two-tailed confidence interval; this is a placeholder to remind us.

\end{Shaded}

With this in hand, let's calculate the confidence intervals.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.2452703
\end{verbatim}

These values indicate the range of scores in which we are 95\% confident that our true mean difference (\(\bar{X_{1}}-\bar{X_{2}}\)) lies. Stated another way, we are 95\% confident that the true mean difference lies between -2.80 and 0.25 Because this interval crosses zero, we cannot rule out that the true mean difference is 0.00. This result is consistent with our non-significant \emph{p} value. For these types of statistics, the 95\% confidence interval and \emph{p} value will always be yoked together.

\hypertarget{effect-size-1}{%
\subsubsection{Effect Size}\label{effect-size-1}}

Whereas \emph{p} values address statistical significance, effect sizes address the magnitude of difference. There are two common effect sizes that are used with the independent samples \emph{t}-test. The first is the \emph{d} statistic, which measures, in standard deviation units, the distance between the two means. The simplest formula involves the \emph{t} value and sample sizes:

\[d = t\sqrt{\frac{N_{1}+N_{2}}{N_{1}N_{2}}}\]

With a \emph{t} value of -1.675 and sample sizes at 33 each, we can easily calculate this. Small, medium, and large sizes for the \emph{d} statistic are .2, .5, and .8, respectively (irrespective of sign).

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -0.4123565
\end{verbatim}

Our value, -0.412 suggests a small-to-medium effect size. We might wonder why it wasn't statistically significant? Later we will discuss power and the relationship between sample size, one vs.~two-tailed hypotheses, and effect sizes.

Eta square, \(\eta^2\) is the proportion of variance of a test variable that is a function of the grouping variable. A value of 0 indicates that the difference in the mean scores is equal to 0, where a value of 1 indicates that the sample means differ, and the test scores do not differ within each group. The following equation can be used to compute \(\eta^2\). Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

\[\eta^{2} =\frac{t^{2}}{t^{2}+(N_{1}+N_{2}-2)}\] Let's calculate it:

Let's rework the problem in R. We start at the top of the flowchart, evaluating the statistical assumptions.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-1}{%
\subsection{Evaluating the Statistical Assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-1}}

With an eye on our data, we can begin to explore the statistical assumptions associated with the independent samples \emph{t}-test. Here's where we are in the workflow:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/IndSampleAssmptns.jpg}
\caption{The workflow for the one sample \emph{t}-test highlighting the evaluation of assumptions section}
\end{figure}

All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. The independent-samples \emph{t}-test has four:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The scores on the test variable as independent of each other. This is a research design issue and the independent-samples \emph{t}-test is not robust to violating this assumption.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If physicians' verbal communication was evaluated and reported for more than one patient, this vignette would violate the assumption of the independent samples \emph{t}-test. For the sake of simplicity, let's presume that each was evaluated on verbal communication for only one patient. If the research scenario was such that physicians contributed multiple datapoints a potential analytic choice that is robust to such a violation is \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/MultilevelModeling/}{multilevel modeling}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The test variable should be continuously scaled. This is also a matter of research design and no statistical analysis is required.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our test variable is an evaluation of verbal interactions; this is continuously scaled and has the properties of \emph{interval}-level data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The test variable is normally distributed. We can check this several ways:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    visually with histograms (perhaps with superimposed curves) and boxplots,
  \item
    calculation of skew and kurtosis values,
  \item
    calculation of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The variances of the normally distributed test variable for both levels of the grouping factor are equal. This is called the homogeneity of variance test and is easily calculated with a Levene's test of homogeneity of variance.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{is-the-dependent-variable-normally-distributed-at-each-level-of-the-grouping-variable}{%
\subsubsection{Is the dependent variable normally distributed at each level of the grouping variable?}\label{is-the-dependent-variable-normally-distributed-at-each-level-of-the-grouping-variable}}

We can begin to evaluate the assumption of normality by obtaining the descriptive statistics with the \emph{describe()} function from the \emph{psych} package.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

From this, we learn that the overall verbal mean is 8.25 with a standard deviation of 3.14. The values for skew (0.44) and kurtosis (1.34) fall below the areas of concern (below the absolute value of 3 for skew; below the absolute values of 10 for kurtosis) identified by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}.

Recall that one of the assumptions for independent samples \emph{t}-test is that the variable of interest is normally distributed within each level of the grouping variable. The \emph{describeBy()} function in the \emph{psych} package allows us to obtain these skew and kurtosis at both levels of the grouping variable.

If we feed the function the entire df, it will give us results for each level of PatientRace for each variable, including variables for which such disaggregation is nonsensible (i.e., ID, PatientRace). If we had a large df, we might want to create a tiny df that only includes our variable(s) of interest. For now, it is not problematic to include all the variables.

In this analysis we are interested in the verbal variable. We see that patients who are Black received verbal interactions from physicians that were quantified by a mean score of 7.61 (\emph{SD} = 2.99); physicians' scores for White patients were 8.89 (\emph{SD} = 3.20). Skew and kurtosis values for the verbal ratings with Black patients were -.37 and -.14, respectively. They were 1.07 and 1.54 for White patients. As before, these fall well below the absolute values of 3 (skew) and 10 (kurtosis) that are considered to be concerning.

Beyond skew and kurtosis, we can formally test for deviations from normality with a Shapiro-Wilk. The script below first groups the data by PatientRace and then applies the \emph{rstatix::shapiro\_test()}. We want the results to be non-significant.

The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the dependent variable, evaluation of verbal interaction with the patient was normally distributed within Black patients \((W = 0.977, p = 0.677)\), but not within White patients \((W = 0.922, p = 0.020\). That is, the distribution of verbal communication scores for physicians attending to White patients was statistically significantly different from a normal distribution.

Should we be concerned? A general rule of thumb is that when cell sizes are larger than 15 the independent \emph{t}-test should be relatively robust to violations of normality \citep{green_using_2017}.

\subsubsection{Are the variances of the dependent variable similar across the levels of the grouping factor?}\label{are-the-variances-of-the-dependent-variable-similar-across-the-levels-of-the-grouping-factor}}

One of the assumptions of the independent samples \emph{t}-test is that the variances of the dependent variable (verbal communication) are similar for both levels of the PatientRace factor. We can use the Levene's test to do this. We want this value to be non-significant \((p > .05)\). If violated, we we can use the Welch's test because it is robust to the violation of the homogeneity of variance.

Using \emph{rstatix::levene\_test()}, we simply need to point to the data, provide a ``formula'' in the form of ``dependent variable by grouping variable,'' and specify about how to center the data. The median is a commonly used because it provides a more robust test.

The results of the Levene's test are presented as an \emph{F} statistic. We'll get to \emph{F} distributions in the next chapter. For now, it is just important to know how to report and interpret them:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Degrees of freedom are 1 and 64
\item
  The value of the \emph{F} statistic is 0.039
\item
  The \emph{p} value is 0.843 (i.e., greater than .05)
\end{itemize}

Happily, our Levene's result is \((F[1, 64] = 0.039, p = 0.843)\) not significant. Because \emph{p} is greater than .05, we have not violated the homogeneity of variance assumption. That is to say, the variance in the patient race groups is not statistically significantly different from each other. We can use the regular (Student's) formulation of the \emph{t}-test for independent samples.

\hypertarget{apa-style-write-up-of-testing-the-assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{APA style write-up of testing the assumptions}\label{apa-style-write-up-of-testing-the-assumptions}}

My practice is to create APA style drafts of the different sections of the analysis as I work along. Here's how I might capture our evaluation of the statistical assumptions:

\begin{quote}
We began by analyzing the data to see if it met the statistical assumptions for analysis with an independent samples \emph{t}-test. One assumption is that the dependent variable be normally distributed within the both levels of the grouping variable. We evaluated skew and kurtosis using Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines of the absolute values of 3 (skew) and 10 (kurtosis). Our results were well-within these boundary conditions. Specifically, the verbal ratings of physicians with Black patients were -.37 and -.14 for skew and kurtosis, respectively; they were 1.07 and 1.54 for White patients. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the dependent variable was normally distributed within Black patients \((W = 0.977, p = 0.677)\), but not within White patients \((W = 0.922, p = 0.020)\). That is, the distribution of verbal communication scores for physicians attending to White patients was statistically significantly different from a normal distribution. Results of Levene's homogeneity of variance test suggested that the variance in each of the patient race groups was not statistically significantly different from each other \((F[1, 64] = 0.039, p = 0.843)\). Because the independent samples \emph{t}-test is relatively robust to violations of normality when samples sizes have at least 15 participants per cell \citep{green_using_2017} and there was no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption we proceded with the Student's formulation of the \emph{t}-test for independent samples.
\end{quote}

Odds are, owing to space limitations in journals, you would not provide this much detail about an independent samples \emph{t}-test in an empirical manuscript. I am encouraging you to do so as you work through these chapters because it is good practice for thinking through the logic and sequencing of statistics as well as writing results in APA style.

\hypertarget{computing-the-independent-samples-t-test}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Computing the Independent Samples \emph{t}-Test}{Computing the Independent Samples t-Test}}\label{computing-the-independent-samples-t-test}}

We are ready to compute the independent samples \emph{t}-test.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/IntSampT.jpg}
\caption{A colorful image of a workflow for the paired samples \emph{t}-test focusing on the computation of the t-test}
\end{figure}

Calculating an independent samples \emph{t}-test is possible through base R and a number of packages. Kassambara's \citeyearpar{kassambara_pipe-friendly_nodate} \emph{rstatix} package is one we can use for all of the \emph{t}-test and ANOVA problems that we will work. I like it for several reasons. First, it was designed to be ``pipe-friendly'' in a manner that is consistent with the \emph{tidyverse} approach to working in R and there are numerous tutorials. Additionally, \emph{rstatix} objects work well with \emph{ggpubr}, one of my favorite packages for graphing data and results.

In the script below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the first element points to the dataframe
\item
  the second element provides a ``formula''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we are predicting ``Verbal'' from ``PatientRace''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  the third element, ``var.equal=TRUE'' means that we are using Student's formulation (because we did not violate the homogeneity of variance assumption)
\item
  specifying ``detailed = TRUE'' will produce the 95\% confidence interval around the difference in the two means
\end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}

From this output we can start to draft our \emph{t} string: \(t(64) = -1.675, p = 0.099, CI95(-2.80, 0.25)\).

Separately, we must request the effect size. Earlier in the lesson we calculated both Cohen's \emph{d} and eta-squared. Unfortunately, the \emph{rstatix} package only offers the Cohen's \emph{d} for \emph{t}-tests. If you wanted an eta-squared, it would be easy enough to hand-calculate (or obtain from another R package).

\end{verbatim}

We can update our \emph{t} string to include the effect size: \(t(64) = -1.675, p = 0.099, CI95(-2.80, 0.25), d = -0.412\)

What does this mean? Our result is not-significant. Our estimate of the difference in verbal communication ratings when physicians interacted with Black and White patients was -1.675. We are 95\% confident that that true mean difference is as low as -2.80 or as high as 0.25. Because the confidence interval crosses zero, we cannot be certain that the true difference is zero. This is consistent with the non-significant \emph{p} value and effect size. Our output even tells us that the \emph{d} of -0.41 is small.

\subsection{What if we had violated the homogeneity of variance assumption?}\label{what-if-we-had-violated-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption}}

Earlier we used the Levene's test to examine the homogeneity of variance assumption. If we had violated it, the Welch's formulation of the independent sample \emph{t}-test is available to us. The \emph{rstatix} package makes this easy. We simply change the \emph{var.equal} to \emph{FALSE}. This will produce the Welch's alternative, which takes into consideration violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption. Conveniently, ``Student's'' or ``Welch's'' will serve as the first row of the output.

\end{verbatim}

Likely because of the similarity of the standard deviations associated with each level of patient race and our equal cell sizes, this changes nothing about our conclusion. Note that the degrees of freedom in the Student's \emph{t}-test analysis (the first one) was 64; in the Welch's version, the degrees of freedom is 63.685. It is this change that, when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated, can make the Welch's results more conservative (i.e., less likely to have a statistically significant result).

Putting it altogether, here is an APA Style results section:

The figure we created earlier in the lesson would be sufficient for a journal article. However, using \emph{rstatix} in combination with \emph{ggpubbr} can be quite powerful. The result can be a figure that includes the \emph{t}-test results and ``significance bars.'' To do this, we first need to re-run the \emph{rstatix::t\_test}, but adding to it by

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  including ``add\_significance()'' script after the pipe, and
\item
  saving it as an object, which I'm naming ``pair.test.''

Determining which figure is best will likely depend on your outlet, your audience, your goals, and your personal preferences. For example, a print journal might prefer a black-and-white figure (with no fill in the boxes). This is accomplished easily enough by removing (or, hashtagging out) the ``color'' and ``palette'' arguments.

\hypertarget{power-in-independent-samples-t-tests}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Power in Independent Samples \emph{t}-tests}{Power in Independent Samples t-tests}}\label{power-in-independent-samples-t-tests}}

Researchers often use power analysis packages to estimate the sample size needed to detect a statistically significant effect, if, in fact, there is one. Utilized another way, these tools allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. If the probability is unacceptably low, we may want to revise or stop. A helpful overview of power as well as guidelines for how to use the \emph{pwr} package can be found at a \href{https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{Quick-R website} \citep{kabacoff_power_2017}.

In Champely's \emph{pwr} package, we can conduct a power analysis for a variety of designs, including the independent samples \emph{t}-test that we worked in this lesson. There are a number of interrelating elements of power:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample size, \emph{n} refers to the number of observations in each group; our vignette had 33
\item
  \emph{d} refers to the difference between means divided by the pooled standard deviation; we can use the value of Cohen's \emph{d} for this
\item
  \emph{power} refers to the power of a statistical test; conventionally it is set at .80
\item
  \emph{sig.level} refers to our desired alpha level; conventionally it is set at .05
\item
  \emph{type} indicates the type of test we ran; this was ``two.sample''
\item
  \emph{alternative} refers to whether the hypothesis is non-directional/two-tailed (``two.sided'') or directional/one-tailed(``less'' or ``greater'')
\end{itemize}

In this script, we must specify \emph{all-but-one} parameter; the remaining parameter must be defined as NULL. R will calculate the value for the missing parameter.

When we conduct a ``power analysis'' (i.e., the likelihood of a hypothesis test detecting an effect if there is one), we specify, ``power=NULL''. Using the data from our results, we learn from this first run, that our statistical power was 0.38. That is, given the value of the mean difference (1.276) we had a 38\% chance of detecting a statistically significant effect if there was one. This is consistent with our non-significant result.

Researchers frequently use these tools to estimate the sample size required to obtain a statistically significant effect. In these scenarios we set \emph{n} to \emph{NULL}. Using the results from the simulation of our research vignette, you can see that we would have needed 93 individuals (per group; 186 total) for the \emph{p} value to be \textless{} .05.

Curiously, our result is still not statistically significant: \(t(184) = 1.713, p = 0.088, d = 0.251, CI95[-0.129, 1.832]\). Given the closeness of our means (9.025, 8.173), this makes sense to me. Additionally, it does show us, though, how power is influenced by sample size. Holding all else equal, the larger the sample, the more likely we are to have a statistically significant result.

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands).

Additionally, please complete at least one set of \emph{hand calculations}, that is using the code demonstrated in the chapter to work through the formulas that compute the independent samples \emph{t}-test. At this stage in your learning, you may ignore any missingness in your dataset by excluding all rows with missing data in your variables of interest.

\subsection{Problem \#1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed}\label{problem-1-rework-the-research-vignette-as-demonstrated-but-change-the-random-seed-1}}

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation of the research vignette, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe even in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar. That said, don't be alarmed if what was non-significant in my working of the problem becomes significant. Our selection of \emph{p} \textless{} .05 (and the corresponding 95\% confidence interval) means that 5\% of the time there could be a difference in statistical significance.

\subsection{Problem \#2: Rework the research vignette, but change something about the simulation}\label{problem-2-rework-the-research-vignette-but-change-something-about-the-simulation-1}}

Rework the independent samples \emph{t}-test in the lesson by changing something else about the simulation. You might have noticed that my re-simulation of a smaller sample size did not produce a statistically significant result. You may wish to pick a value in between the primary lecture \emph{N} and the re-simulation to see what it takes to achieve statistical significance. Alternatively, you could specify different means and/or standard deviations.

The independent-samples t-test is useful when you want to compare means across two different groups. That is, the people in the comparison groups must be different from each other.

\subsubsection{Narrate the research vignette, describing the variables and their role in the analysis}\label{narrate-the-research-vignette-describing-the-variables-and-their-role-in-the-analysis-1}}

I want to ask the question, ``Do the course evaluation ratings for the traditional pedagogy subscale differ for CPY and ORG students in the ANOVA class?''

I will use the mean rating for the traditional pedagogy subscale. As a mean, it retains its continuous, Likert scaling, ranging from 1 to 5 (with higher scores being more positive).

My predictor variable will be department. It has two levels: CPY and ORG.

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could change the course (i.e., Multivariate or Psychometrics) and/or change the dependent variable to one of the other scales}.

\hypertarget{simulate-or-import-and-format-data-1}{%
\subsubsection{Simulate (or import) and format data}\label{simulate-or-import-and-format-data-1}}

First, bring in the dataset.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To avoid ``dependency'' in the data, I will just use data from the ANOVA course. Let's first trim it to just students who took ANOVA

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{JustANOVA }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{subset}\NormalTok{(big, Course }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"ANOVA"}\NormalTok{)}

I will create a mean score of completed items from the traditional pedagogy scale.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To make it easier for teaching, I will make a super tiny df with just the predictor and continuous variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{IndT\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ (dplyr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(JustANOVA, Dept, TradPed))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And further trim to non-missing data

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{IndT\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{na.omit}\NormalTok{(IndT\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Are the structures of the variables as follows: * Grouping variable: factor * Dependent variable: numerical or integer

In our case we want Department to be a factor with two levels and the SCRPed variable to be integer or numerical.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(IndT\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':  112 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Dept   : chr  "CPY" "CPY" "CPY" "CPY" ...
 $ TradPed: num  4.4 3.8 4 3 4.8 3.5 4.6 3.8 3.6 4.6 ...
 - attr(*, "na.action")= 'omit' Named int [1:2] 74 84
  ..- attr(*, "names")= chr [1:2] "202" "234"
\end{verbatim}

Since the Department is a character variable, we need to change it to be a factor.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{IndT\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Dept }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(IndT\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Dept)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 Factor w/ 2 levels "CPY","ORG": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
\end{verbatim}

Without further coding, R will order the factors alphabetically. This is fine. CPY will be the base/intercept and ORG will be the comparison (this becomes more important in regression).

\end{verbatim}

Although I included Dept in the descriptives, it is a factor and therefore the values around distribution are rather senseless.

TradPed, though, is a continuously scored variable:

Skew = -0.763 (CPY) and -1.183 (ORG) falls below the \textbar3.0\textbar{} threshold of concern (Klein, 2016) Kurtosis = 0.156 (CPY) and 0.583 (ORG) falls below the \textbar10.0\textbar{} threshold of concern (Klein, 2016)

We can use the Shapiro Wilk test for a formal test of normality

2 ORG   TradPed      0.851 0.000544 
\end{verbatim}

The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the dependent variable, traditional pedagogy, differed significantly from a normal distribution for both CPY students \((W = 0.918, p < 0.001)\) and ORG students\((W = 0.851, p < 0.001)\).

Should we be concerned? A general rule of thumb is that when cell sizes are larger than 15 the independent \emph{t}-test should be relatively robust to violations of normality \citep{green_using_2017}. Although there are more CPY than ORG students, we are well-powered.

For fun (not required), let's produce a pairs.panels.

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{05-tIndSample_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-44-1.pdf}

We can see that we'll have more CPY students than ORG students. Although our kurtosis was below \textbar10\textbar{} our distribution looks negatively skewed, with the majority of the scores being on the high end of the scale.

And now for homogeneity of variance:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Levene's test for homogeneity of variance indicated that we did not violate the assumption of homogeneity of variance \((F[1, 110] = 2.460, p = 0.120)\). That is to say, the variance in each of the departments is not statistically significantly different from each other. We can use the regular (Student's) formulation of the \emph{t}-test for independent samples.

From this output we learn that the value of the \emph{t}-test is 1.423 and is non-significant \emph{p = 0.148}. We are 95\% confident that the mean diference falls between -0.102 and 0.618. Because this threshold crosses zero, we cannot be certain that the true difference in means is not zero. Here's how I would represent these results in a statistical string: \(t(110) = 1.423, p = 0.158, CI95(0.102, 0.619)\).

The value of Cohen's \emph{d} statistic (interpreted in standard deviation units) is 0.300 and is small. We can add this value to the statistical string: \(t(110) = 1.423, p = 0.158, CI95 (0.102, 0.619), d = 0.300\).

An independent samples \emph{t}-test was conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that there would be differences in course evaluation ratings of traditional pedagogy between academic departments (CPY, ORG).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
We began by analyzing the data to see if it met the statistical assumptions for analysis with an independent samples \emph{t}-test. One assumption is that the dependent variable be normally distributed within the both levels of the grouping variable. We evaluated skew and kurtosis using Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines of the absolute values of 3 (skew) and 10 (kurtosis). Our results were well-within these boundary conditions. Specifically, the traditional pedagogy ratings for CPY were -0.763 and 0.156 for skew and kurtosis, respectively; they were -1.183 and 0.583 for ORG. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the dependent variable, traditional pedagogy, differed significantly from a normal distribution for both CPY students \((W = 0.918, p < 0.001)\) and ORG students \((W = 0.851, p < 0.001)\). Levene's test for homogeneity of variance indicated that we did not violate the assumption of homogeneity of variance \((F[1, 110] = 2.460, p = 0.120)\). That is to say, the variance in each of the departments is not statistically significantly different from each other. Because the independent samples \emph{t}-test is relatively robust to violations of normality when samples sizes have at least 15 participants per cell \citep{green_using_2017} and there was no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption we proceded with the Student's formulation of the \emph{t}-test for independent samples.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The independent samples \emph{t}-test was nonsignificant, \(t(110) = 1.423, p = 0.158\), the effect size (d = 0.300) was small. The 95\% confidence interval for the difference in means ranged from -0.102 to 0.619. Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1; the results are illustrated in Figure 1.

We were at 61\% power. That is, given the value of the mean difference (), we had a 61\% chance of detecting a statistically significant effect if there was one. How big of a sample would it take?

To find a statistically significant difference, we would need 175 per group. This large size is consistent with the small effect -- that there isn't really a difference between the two groups.

\subsection{Hand Calculations}\label{hand-calculations-2}}

I will use the same example (and same dataset) for hand calculations. Before we continue:

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. This is because the formula we have used for the hand-calculations presumes that we have a balanced design (i.e., that the cell sizes are equal). When cell sizes are unequal (i.e., an unbalanced design) the \emph{rstatix::t\_test} will produce different results.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in these statistics. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of \emph{t}-tests, we would take more time to understand what is occurring.

Researchers are often interested in knowing if participants score differently on some outcome variable (like affective well-being) across two conditions. These conditions could be before and after an intervention; they could also be interventionless exposures such as scary versus funny movies. In these simple designs, the paired \emph{t}-test can be used to test the researchers' hypotheses.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Introducing the Paired Samples \emph{t}-test}{Introducing the Paired Samples t-test}}\label{introducing-the-paired-samples-t-test}}

There are a couple of typical use cases for the paired samples \emph{t}-test. Repeated measures or change-over-time is a very common use. In this case, the research participant may take a pre-test, be exposed to an intervention or other type of stimulus, then take a post-test. Owing to the limitations of the statistics, all participants must be exposed to the same intervention/stimulus.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/prepost_paired.jpg}
\caption{An image of a row with three boxes: pre-test (in blue), intervention or exposure to stimulus (in light red), post-test (in blue) representing the use of a paired samples \emph{t}-test in a repeated measures design}
\end{figure}

A second common use is the assessment of a research participant in two competing conditions. An example might be the galvanic skin response ratings when a participant's hand is submerged in ice versus the GSR ratings when the hand is not exposed in ice. A strength of this design is the within-subjects' control of the participant.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/conditions_paired.jpg}
\caption{An image of a row with two boxes labeled Condition A in light blue) and Condition B (in dark blue). This represents the use of a paired samples \emph{t}-test to compare across conditions}
\end{figure}

In the formula for the paired samples \emph{t}-test we see a \(\bar{D}\) in the numerator. This represents the \emph{difference} between the continuously scaled scores in the two conditions. The denominator involves a standard deviation of the difference scores (\(\hat\sigma_D\)) and the square root of the sample size.

\[t = \frac{\bar{D}}{\hat\sigma_D / \sqrt{N}}\] Although these types of research design and analyses are quite handy, they have some limitations. First, the paired samples \emph{t}-test cannot establish causality because it lacks elements such as comparing conditions (e.g., treatment vs.~control) and random assignment to those conditions. If a research wants to compare pre-post change as a result of participating in more-than-one condition, a \protect\hyperlink{Mixed}{mixed design ANOVA} would be a better option. Second, the paired samples \emph{t}-test cannot accommodate more than two comparison conditions. If the researcher wants to compare three or or more time periods or conditions, they will want to consider \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{repeated measures ANOVA} or \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/MultilevelModeling/}{multilevel/hierarchical linear modeling}.

\hypertarget{workflow-for-paired-samples-t-test}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workflow for Paired Samples \emph{t}-test}{Workflow for Paired Samples t-test}}\label{workflow-for-paired-samples-t-test}}

The following is a proposed workflow for conducting the paired samples \emph{t}-test.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/PairedSampleWrkFlw.jpg}
\caption{A colorful image of a workflow for the paired samples \emph{t}-test}
\end{figure}

If the data meets the assumptions associated with the research design (e.g., independence of difference scores and a continuously scaled metric for that difference score), these are the steps for the analysis of an independent samples \emph{t}-test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prepare (upload) data.
\item
  Explore data with

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    graphs
  \item
    descriptive statistics
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Assess normality of the difference scores via skew and kurtosis
\item
  Compute the paired samples \emph{t}-test
\item
  Compute an effect size (frequently the \emph{d} or \emph{eta} statistic)
\item
  Manage Type I error
\item
  Sample size/power analysis (which you should think about first, but in the context of teaching statistics, it's more pedagogically sensible, here).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-3}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-3}}

Empirically published articles where \emph{t}-tests are the primary statistic are difficult to locate. Having exhausted the psychology archives, I located this article in an interdisciplinary journal focused on palliative medicine. The research vignette for this lesson examined differences in physician's verbal and nonverbal communication with Black and White patients at the end of life \citep{elliott_differences_2016}.

Elliott and colleagues \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} were curious to know if hospital-based physicians (56\% White, 26\% Asian, 7.4\% each Black and Hispanic) engaged in verbal and nonverbal communication differently with Black and White patients. Black and White patient participants were matched on characteristics deemed important to the researchers (e.g., critically and terminally ill, prognostically similar). Interactions in the intensive care unit were audio and video recorded and then coded on dimensions of verbal and nonverbal communication.

Because each physician saw a pair of patients (i.e., one Black patient and one White patient), the researchers utilized a paired samples, or dependent \emph{t}-test. This statistical choice was consistent with the element of the research design that controlled for physician effects through matching patients on critical characteristics. Below are the primary findings of the study.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
& Black Patients & White Patients & \\
\midrule\noalign{}

Nonverbal skill score (range 0 - 5) & 2.68(.84) & 2.93(.77) & 0.014 \\
\end{longtable}

The primary analysis utilized by Elliott and colleagues \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} was the paired samples \emph{t}-test. We will replicate that exact analysis with simulated data.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Simulating Data for the Paired Samples \emph{t}-test}{Simulating Data for the Paired Samples t-test}}\label{simulating-data-for-the-paired-samples-t-test}}

Below is the code I used to simulate the data. The following code assumes 33 physician participants who had separate interactions with critically ill, end-of-life stage patients, who were identified as Black and White. The Elliott et al. \citeyearpar{elliott_differences_2016} manuscript describe the process for coding verbal and nonverbal communication for video/audio recordings of the physician/patient interactions. Using that data, I simulate verbal and nonverbal communication scores for 33 physicians who rate patients who identify as Black and White, respectively. This creates four variables.

In the lesson, we will compare verbal communication scores. The nonverbal communication score is available as an option for practice.

Before beginning our analysis, let's check the format of the variables to see if they are consistent with the scale of measurement of the variables. In our case, we expect to see four variables representing the verbal and nonverbal communication of the physicians with the patients who are identified as Black and White. Each of the variables should be continuously scaled and, therefore, should be formatted as \emph{num} (numerical).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(dfPairedSamples)}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   33 obs. of  5 variables:

 $ Verbal_BL: num  8.19 3.3 6.18 4.85 6.91 ...

 $ NVerb_WH : num  2.74 5.02 1.34 2.38 2.91 ...
\end{verbatim}

The four variables of interest are correctly formatted as \emph{num}. Because PhysID (physician ID) will not be used in our analysis, its structure is irrelevant.

Below is code for saving (and then importing) the data in .csv or .rds files. I make choices about saving data based on what I wish to do with the data. If I want to manipulate the data outside of R, I will save it as a .csv file. It is easy to open .csv files in Excel. A limitation of the .csv format is that it does not save any restructuring or reformatting of variables. For this lesson, this is not an issue.

Here is code for saving the data as a .csv and then reading it back into R. I have hashtagged these out, so you will need to remove the hashtags if you wish to run any of these operations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

The .rds form of saving variables preserves any formatting (e.g., creating ordered factors) of the data. A limitation is that these files are not easily opened in Excel. Here is the hashtagged code (remove hashtags if you wish to do this) for writing (and then reading) this data as an .rds file.

Plotting the data is a helpful early step in any data analysis. Further, visualizing the data can help us with a conceptual notion of the statistic we are utilizing. The \emph{ggpubr} package is one of my go-to-tools for quick and easy plots of data. The \emph{ggpaired()} function is especially appropriate for paired data. A \href{https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggpaired.html}{tutorial} is available at datanovia.

Especially unique about this function is that the lines connect the scores of each person across time or conditions. In this research scenario, the lines present the amount of time the physicians spent with each of the two patients they treated.

\subsection{Stating the Hypothesis}\label{stating-the-hypothesis-2}}

In this lesson, I will focus on differences in the verbal communication variable. Specifically, I hypothesize that physician verbal communication scores for Black and White patients will differ. In the hypotheses below, the null hypothesis (\(\mu_D\)) states that the difference score is zero; the alternative hypothesis (\(\mu_D\)) states that the difference score is different from zero.

\[H_{O}: \mu _{D} = 0\] \[H_{A}: \mu _{D} \neq 0\]

Notice the focus on a \emph{difference} score. Even though the R package we will use does not require one for calculation, creating one in our df will be useful for preliminary exploration.

Examining this new variable, because we subtracted the verbal communication ratings of physicians with White patients from those of Black patients a negative score means that physicians had lower verbal engagement with Black patients; a positive score means that physicians had more verbal engagement with White patients.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Calculating the Paired Samples \emph{t}-Test}{Calculating the Paired Samples t-Test}}\label{calculating-the-paired-samples-t-test}}

Let's take another look at the formula for calculating paired samples \emph{t}-test.

\[t = \frac{\bar{D}}{\hat\sigma_D / \sqrt{N}}\] We can use the data from our preliminary exploration in the calculation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The mean difference was .08
\item
  The standard deviation of that difference was 4.14
\item
  The sample size is 33
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FloatTok{0.08}\SpecialCharTok{/}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{4.14}\SpecialCharTok{/}\FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{33}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.111006
\end{verbatim}

The resultant \emph{t} value is 0.111

Hopefully, this hand-calculation provided an indication of how the means, standard deviation, and sample sizes contribute to the estimate of this \emph{t}-test value. Now we ask, ``But it is statistically significant?''

\hypertarget{statistical-significance-2}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Significance}\label{statistical-significance-2}}

Our \emph{t}-value was 0.111. We compare this value to the test critical value in a table of \emph{t} critical values. In-so-doing we must know our degrees of freedom. Because the numerator in a paired samples \emph{t}-test is a single difference score \(\bar{D}\), the associated degrees of freedom is \(N-1\). We must also specify the \emph{p} value (in our case .05) and whether-or-not our hypothesis is unidirectional or bi-directional. Our question only asked, ``Are the verbal communication levels different?'' In this case, the test is two-tailed, or bi-directional.

Let's return to the \href{https://www.statology.org/t-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} for the \emph{t} distribution to compare our \emph{t}-value (0.111) to the column that is appropriate for our:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Degrees of freedom (in this case \(N-1\) or 32)
\item
  Alpha, as represented by \(p < .05\)
\item
  Specification as a one-tailed or two-tailed test

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our alternative hypothesis made no prediction about the direction of the difference; therefore we will use a two-tailed test
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the linked table, when the degrees of freedom reaches 30, there larger intervals. We will use the row representing degrees of freedom of 30. If our \emph{t}-test value is lower than an absolute value of -2.042 or greater than the absolute value of 2.042, then our means are statistically significantly different from each other. In our case, we have not achieved statistical significance and we cannot say that the means are different. The \emph{t} string would look like this: \(t(32) = 0.111, p > .05\)

We can also use the \emph{qt()} function in base R. In the script below, I have indicated an alpha of .05. The ``2'' that follows indicates I want a two-tailed test. The 32 represents my degrees of freedom (\(N-1\)). In a two-tailed test, the regions of rejection will be below the lowerbound (lower.tail=TRUE) and above the upperbound (lower.tail=FALSE).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2.036933
\end{verbatim}

If our \emph{t} value is below the lowerbound (-2.04) or above the upper bound (2.04), then we have rejected the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. As we demonstrated in the hand-calculations, we have not. The ratings of physicians' verbal engagement with patients who are racially identified as Black and White are not statistically significant.

\hypertarget{confidence-intervals-2}{%
\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals-2}}

How confident are we in our result? With paired samples \emph{t}-tests, it is common to report an interval in which we are 95\% confident that our true mean difference exists. Below is the formula, which involves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\bar{D}\) the mean difference score
\item
  \(t_{cv}\) the test critical value for a two-tailed model (even if the hypothesis was one-tailed) where \(\alpha = .05\) and the degrees of freedom are \(N-1\)
\item
  \(s_{d}\) the standard deviation of \(\bar{D}\)
\item
  \(N\) sample size
\end{itemize}

\[\bar{D}\pm t_{cv}(s_{d}/\sqrt{n})\] Let's calculate it:

First, let's get the proper \emph{t} critical value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{qt}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{0.05}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{32}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{lower.tail =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1.548028
\end{verbatim}

These values indicate the range of scores in which we are 95\% confident that our true \(\bar{D}\) lies. Stated another way, we are 95\% confident that the true mean difference lies between -1.39 and 1.55. Because this interval crosses zero, we cannot rule out that the true mean difference is 0.00. This result is consistent with our non-significant \emph{p} value. For these types of statistics, the 95\% confidence interval and \emph{p} value will always be yoked together.

\hypertarget{effect-size-2}{%
\subsubsection{Effect Size}\label{effect-size-2}}

Effect sizes address the magnitude of difference. There are two common effect sizes that are used with the paired samples \emph{t}-test. The first is the \emph{d} statistic, which measures, in standard deviation units, the distance between the two means. Regardless of sign, values of .2, .5, and .8 are considered to be small, medium, and large, respectively.

Because the paired samples \emph{t}-test used the difference score in the numerator, there are two easy options for calculating this effect:

\[d=\frac{\bar{D}}{\hat\sigma_D}=\frac{t}{\sqrt{N}}\]

The first is to use the mean and standard deviation associated with the difference score:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FloatTok{0.08}\SpecialCharTok{/}\FloatTok{4.14}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.01932262
\end{verbatim}

Within rounding error, both calculations result in a value (\(d = 0.02\)) that is quite small.

Eta squared, \(\eta^2\) is the proportion of variance of a test variable that is a function of the grouping variable. A value of 0 indicates that mean of the difference scores is equal to 0, where a value of 1 indicates that the difference scores in the sample are all the same nonzero value, and the test scores do not differ within each group. The following equation can be used to compute \(\eta^2\). Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

\[\eta^{2} =\frac{N(\bar{D}^{2})}{N(\bar{D}^{2}+(N-1)(\hat\sigma_D^{^{2}})}=\frac{t^{2}}{t^{2}+(N_{1}-1)}\] The first calculation option uses the N and the mean difference score:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Within rounding errors, and similar to our \emph{d} statistic, the \(\eta^2\) value (0.0004) is quite small.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-2}{%
\subsection{Evaluating the Statistical Assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-2}}

With an eye on our data, we can begin to explore the statistical assumptions associated with the paired samples \emph{t}-test. Here's where we are in the workflow:

\includegraphics{images/ttests/PairedAssmptns.jpg} All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. The paired-samples \emph{t}-test has three:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The difference scores (i.e., the difference on the outcome across time or conditions) on the test variable are independent of each other. This is a matter of research design and no further statistical evaluation is required.
\item
  The test variable should be continuously scaled. This is also a matter of research design and no statistical analysis is required.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our test variable is measured in minutes; this is continuously scaled and has the properties of \emph{interval}-level data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The \emph{difference scores} of the test variable are normally distributed. We can check this several ways:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    visually with histograms (perhaps with superimposed curves) and boxplots,
  \item
    calculation of skew and kurtosis values,
  \item
    calculation of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{are-the-difference-scores-of-the-test-variable-normally-distributed}{%
\subsubsection{Are the difference scores of the test variable normally distributed?}\label{are-the-difference-scores-of-the-test-variable-normally-distributed}}

We can begin to evaluate normality by obtaining the descriptive statistics with the \emph{describe()} function from the \emph{psych} package.

We observe that the skew and kurtosis values for Verbal\_BL and Verbal\_WH are well below the areas of concern (below the absolute value of 3 for skew; below the absolute values of 10 for kurtosis) identified by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}.

Recall, though that the normality assumption for the paired samples \emph{t}-test concerns the \emph{difference score} (Verbal\_D). We see that the mean difference is 0.08 (\emph{SD} = 4.14). Its skew (-0.42) and kurtosis (-0.54) are also well-below the thresholds of concern.

Beyond skew and kurtosis, we can formally test for deviations from normality with a Shapiro-Wilk. We want the results to be non-significant.

Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality are not statistically significant \((W = 0.97, p = 0.57)\). This means that the distribution of difference scores is not statistically significantly different from a normal distribution.

\subsubsection{APA style write-up of testing the assumptions}\label{apa-style-write-up-of-testing-the-assumptions-1}}

My practice is to create APA style drafts of the different sections of the analysis as I work along. Here's how I might capture our evaluation of the statistical assumptions:

\begin{quote}
We began by analyzing the data to see if it met the statistical assumptions for analysis with a paired samples \emph{t}-test. One assumption is that the difference scores of dependent variable are normally distributed. We evaluated skew and kurtosis using Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines of the absolute values of 3 (skew) and 10 (kurtosis). Our results were well-within these boundary conditions. Further, a non-significant Shapiro-Wilk test of normality suggested that the distribution of difference scores was not statistically significant from a normal distribution \((W = 0.97, p = 0.57)\).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Computing the Paired Samples \emph{t}-Test}{Computing the Paired Samples t-Test}}\label{computing-the-paired-samples-t-test}}

We are ready to compute the paired samples \emph{t}-test.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ttests/PairedT.jpg}
\caption{A colorful image of a workflow for the paired samples \emph{t}-test}
\end{figure}

Calculating a paired samples \emph{t}-test is possible through base R and a number of packages. Kassambara's \citeyearpar{kassambara_pipe-friendly_nodate} \emph{rstatix} package is one we can use for all of the \emph{t}-test and ANOVA problems that we will work.

A challenge in evaluating within-persons data is the \emph{shape} of the data. The simulation resulted in a \emph{wide} (also termed person-level or multivariate) format, where each of the 33 physicians has the verbal and non-verbal communication scores with Black and White patients. We need to reshape the data to a long (also termed person-period or univariate) format. Although it may seem a bit tricky at first, this is a skill you will return to in many longitudinal or repeated measures analyses.

In the script below we are using the \emph{melt()} and \emph{setDT} functions from the \emph{data.table} package. We put stable (i.e., time-invarient, ``one-per-person'') variables in a concatonated variable list of ``id.vars.'' We create separate lists of the variables that change over time. In this case, each physician saw one Black patient and one White patient. Therefore, every physician will have two rows of data. For each variable collected at both points, we create concatonated lists.

After the reshaping, let's recheck the structure of our data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(df\_long)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':  66 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ PhysID     : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ PatientRace: Factor w/ 2 levels "1","2": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Verbal     : num  8.19 3.3 6.18 4.85 6.91 ...
 $ Nonverbal  : num  3.099 4.234 0.429 1.835 3.704 ...
 - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr> 
\end{verbatim}

The dependent variables Verbal and Nonverbal are continuously scaled, so the \emph{num} designation is appropriate. Similarly, PatientRace is categorical, so \emph{Factor} is appropriate. Because labels (instead of numbers) can minimize misinterpretation (or forgetting), I would prefer to use ``Black'' and ``White'' as opposed to ``1'' and ``2''. To further reduce the possibility of error, it is easy enough to create a second, parallel, variable.

We are now ready to perform the paired samples \emph{t}-test. In the script below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the first element points to the dataframe
\item
  the second element provides a ``formula''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we are predicting ``Verbal'' from ``PtRace''
  \end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}

This output provides information to get us started in drafting the APA style results. Identical to all the information we hand-calculated, we would write the \emph{t} string this way: \(t(32) = 0.113, p = .911, CI95(-1.39, 1.55)\). Our results show that the mean difference in physician verbal communication scores with Black and White patients was 0.081. Taking a look at the confidence interval, we are 95\% confident that the true difference in means falls between the values of -1.386 and 1.549. What is critically important is that this confidence interval crosses zero. There is an important link between the CI95\% and statistical significance. When the CI95\% includes zero, \emph{p} will not be lower than 0.05.

We still need to calculate the effect size.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Keeping in mind the interpretive criteria of .2, .5, and .8, as small, medium, and large effect sizes, we see that \(d = 0.020\) is quite small. We can add it to our \emph{t}-string and draft the results: \(t(32) = 0.113, p = .911, d = 0.020, CI95(-1.39, 1.55)\).

\hypertarget{apa-style-results-2}{%
\section{APA Style Results}\label{apa-style-results-2}}

Putting it altogether we can assemble an APA style results section. Code for a table of means, standard deviations, and correlation follow the write-up of results. For inclusion in a manuscript, I would rework the export of the table to delete the difference score (i.e., Verbal\_D). I might also exclude the rows of confidence intervals around the correlations.

A paired samples \emph{t}-test was conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that there would be differences in the degree of physicians' verbal engagement as a function of the patient's race (Black, White). The paired samples \emph{t}-test was nonsignificant, \emph{t}(32) = 0.133, \emph{p} = .911. The small magnitude of the effect size (\emph{d} = 0.02) was consistent with the nonsignificant result. The 95\% confidence interval for the difference in means was quite wide and included the value of zero (95\%CI{[}-1.386, 1.549{]}). Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1; the results are illustrated in Figure 1.

The figure we created earlier in the lesson would be sufficient for a journal article. However, using \emph{rstatix} in combination with \emph{ggpubbr} can be quite powerful. The result can be a figure that includes the \emph{t}-test results and ``significance bars.'' To do this, we first need to re-run the \emph{rstatix::t\_test}, but adding to it by

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  including ``add\_significance()'' script after the pipe, and
\item
  saving it as an object, which I'm naming ``pair.test.''
\end{itemize}

We could have done this in the initial run (but I didn't want to make the test-statistic unnecessarily confusing).

\includegraphics{06-tPairedSamples_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-27-1.pdf} The tools available offer a great deal of flexibility. Determining which figure is best will likely depend on your outlet, your audience, and your personal preferences. For example, a print journal might prefer a black-and-white figure (with no fill in the boxes). This is accomplished easily enough by removing (or, hashtagging out) the ``fill = PtRace'' argument.

\hypertarget{power-in-paired-samples-t-tests}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Power in Paired Samples \emph{t}-Tests}{Power in Paired Samples t-Tests}}\label{power-in-paired-samples-t-tests}}

Researchers often use power analysis packages to estimate the sample size needed to detect a statistically significant effect, if, in fact, there is one. Utilized another way, these tools allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. If the probability is unacceptably low, we may want to revise or stop. A helpful overview of power as well as guidelines for how to use the \emph{pwr} package can be found at a \href{https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{Quick-R website} \citep{kabacoff_power_2017}.

In Champely's \emph{pwr} package, we can conduct a power analysis for a variety of designs, including the paired \emph{t}-test that we worked in this chapter. There are a number of interrelating elements of power:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample size, \emph{n} refers to the number of pairs; our vignette had 33
\item
  \emph{d} refers to the difference between means divided by the pooled standard deviation; we can use the value of Cohen's \emph{d} for this
\item
  \emph{power} refers to the power of a statistical test; conventionally it is set at .80
\item
  \emph{sig.level} refers to our desired alpha level; conventionally it is set at .05
\item
  \emph{type} indicates the type of test we ran; ours was ``paired''
\item
  \emph{alternative} refers to whether the hypothesis is non-directional/two-tailed (``two.sided'') or directional/one-tailed(``less'' or ``greater'')
\end{itemize}

In this script, we must specify \emph{all-but-one} parameter; the remaining parameter must be defined as NULL. R will calculate the value for the missing parameter.

When we conduct a ``power analysis'' (i.e., the likelihood of a hypothesis test detecting an effect if there is one), we specify, ``power=NULL''. Using the data from our results, we learn from this first run, that our statistical power was at 5\%. That is, given the low value of the mean difference (.08) and the relatively large standard deviation (4.14), we had only a 5\% chance of detecting a statistically significant effect if there was one.

The results indicate that we were powered at 5\%. That is, we had a 5\% chance of finding a statistically significant difference, if in fact there was one.

The new results remain non-significant: \(t(19623) = -1.243, p = 0.241, d = -0.009, 95CI (-0.088, 0.020)\). This tells me these means are quite similar and this is not a function of being under powered.

Conducting power analyses requires that researchers speculate about their values. In this case, in order to estimate sample size, the researcher would need to make some guesses about the difference scores means and standard deviations. These values could be estimated from prior literature or a pilot study.

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-4}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands).

Additionally, please complete at least one set of \emph{hand calculations}, that is use the code demonstrated in the chapter to work through the formulas that compute the paired samples \emph{t}-test. At this stage in your learning, you may ignore any missingness in your dataset by excluding all rows with missing data in your variables of interest.

\subsection{Problem \#1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed}\label{problem-1-rework-the-research-vignette-as-demonstrated-but-change-the-random-seed-2}}

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation of the research vignette, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe even in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar. That said, don't be alarmed if what was non-significant in my working of the problem becomes significant. Our selection of \emph{p} \textless{} .05 (and the corresponding 95\% confidence interval) means that 5\% of the time there could be a difference in statistical significance.

\subsection{Problem \#2: Rework the research vignette, but change something about the simulation}\label{problem-2-rework-the-research-vignette-but-change-something-about-the-simulation-2}}

Rework the paired samples \emph{t}-test in the lesson by changing something else about the simulation. For example, if you are interested in understanding more about power, consider changing the sample size. Alternatively, you could specify different means and/or standard deviations.

\subsubsection{Narrate the research vignette, describing the variables and their role in the analysis}\label{narrate-the-research-vignette-describing-the-variables-and-their-role-in-the-analysis-2}}

I want to ask the question, ``Do students' evaluations of traditional pedagogy (TradPed) change from ANOVA (the first course in the series) to Multivariate (the second course in the series)?.'' Unlike the independent samples \emph{t}-test where we compared students in two different departments, we are comparing \emph{the same} students across two different conditions. In this particular analysis, there is also an element of time. That is the ANOVA class always precedes the multivariate class (with a regression class, taught by a different instructor) in the intervening academic quarter.

This research design has some clear limitations. Threats to internal validity are caused by issues like history and maturation. None-the-less, for the purpose of a statistical demonstration, this dataset works.

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could compare a different combination of courses and/or score one of the other course evaluation subscales (e.g., socially responsive pedagogy or valued-by-me). }

Like most data, some manipulation is required before we can begin the analyses.

\hypertarget{simulate-or-import-and-format-data-2}{%
\subsubsection{Simulate (or import) and format data}\label{simulate-or-import-and-format-data-2}}

Let's import the larger dataset.

\NormalTok{larger }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"ReC.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

The TradPed (traditional pedagogy) variable is an average of the items on that scale. I will first create that variable.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

From the ``larger'' data, let's select only the variable we will use in the analysis. I have included ``long'' in the filename because the structure of the dataset is that course evaluation by each student is in its own row. That is, each student could have up to three rows of data.

We need both ``long'' and ``wide'' forms to conduct the analyses required for both testing the statistical assumptions and performing the paired samples \emph{t}-test.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{paired\_long }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ (dplyr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(larger, deID, Course, TradPed))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

From that reduced variable set, let's create a subset with students only from those two courses.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{paired\_long }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{subset}\NormalTok{(paired\_long, Course }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"ANOVA"} \SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ Course }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Multivariate"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Regarding the structure of the data, we want the conditions (ANOVA, multivariate) to be factors and the TradPed variable to be continuously scaled. The format of the deID variable can be any numerical or categorical format -- just not a ``chr'' (character) variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(paired\_long)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':  198 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ deID   : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ Course : Factor w/ 3 levels "Psychometrics",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...

 - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr> 
\end{verbatim}

R correctly interpreted our variables.

For analyzing the assumptions associated with the paired-samples \emph{t}-test, the format needs to be ``wide'' form (where each student has both observations on one row). Our data is presently in ``long'' form (where each observation is listed in each row). Here's how to reshape the data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{paired\_wide }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ reshape2}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{dcast}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ paired\_long, }\AttributeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ deID }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ Course,}
    \AttributeTok{value.var =} \StringTok{"TradPed"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's recheck the structure.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(paired\_wide)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   119 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ deID        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ ANOVA       : num  4.4 3.8 4 3 4.8 3.5 4.6 3.8 3.6 4.6 ...
 $ Multivariate: num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
\end{verbatim}

You will notice that there is a good deal of missingness in the Multivariate condition. This is caused because the most recent cohort of students had not yet taken the course. While managing missingness is more complex than this, for the sake of simplicity, I will create a dataframe with non-missing data.

Doing so should also help with the hand-calculations later in the worked example.

\hypertarget{evaluate-statistical-assumptions-2}{%
\subsubsection{Evaluate statistical assumptions}\label{evaluate-statistical-assumptions-2}}

We need to evaluate the \emph{distribution of the difference score} in terms of skew and kurtosis. We want this distribution of difference scores to be normally distributed.

This means we need to create a difference score:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

We can use the \emph{psych::describe()} function to obtain skew and kurtosis.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Multivariate     5.00 0.08
DIFF             3.15 0.09
\end{verbatim}

Regarding the DIFF score, the skew (0.56) and kurtosis (3.15) values were well below the threshholds of concern identified by Klein (2016).

We can formally test for deviations from normality with a Shapiro-Wilk. We want the results to be non-significant.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rstatix}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{shapiro\_test}\NormalTok{(paired\_wide, DIFF)}

  <chr>        <dbl>   <dbl>
1 DIFF         0.943 0.00187
\end{verbatim}

Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality are statistically significant \((W = 0.943, p = 0.002)\). This means that the distribution of difference scores are statistically significantly different from a normal distribution.

Although not required in the formal test of instructions, a \emph{pairs panel} of correlations and distributions can be useful in undersatnding our data.

\includegraphics{06-tPairedSamples_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-46-1.pdf} Visual inspection of the distributions of the specific course variables were negatively skewed, with values clustered at the high end of the course evaluation ratings. However, the distribution for the DIFF variable seems relatively normal (although maybe a bit leptokurtic). This is consistent with the statistically significant Shapiro-Wilk test.

Before moving forward, I want to capture my analysis of assumptions:

\begin{quote}
We began by analyzing the data to see if it met the statistical assumptions for analysis with a paired samples t-test. Regarding the assumption of normality, the skew (0.56) and kurtosis (3.15) values associated with the difference between conditions (ANOVA and multivariate) were below the threshholds of concern identified by Klein (2016). In contrast, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality suggested that the distribution of difference scores was statistically significantly different than a normal distribution \((W = 0.943, p = 0.002)\).

So this may be a bit tricky, but our original ``long'' form of the data has more ANOVA evaluations (students who had taken ANOVA had not yet taken multivariate) than multivariate. The paired samples \emph{t} test requires the design to be balanced. When we used the \emph{na.omit()} function with the wide case, we effectively balanced the design, eliminating students who lacked observations across both courses. Let's restructure that wide format back to long format so that the design will be balanced.

I'll begin the \emph{t} string with this output: \(t(76) = -1.341, p = 0.184, CI95(-0.305, 0.069)\). The difference in course evaluations is not statistically significantly difference. We are 955 confident that the true difference in means is as low as -0.301 or as high as 0.060.

We calculate the Cohen's \emph{d} (the effect size) this way:

We have 77 pairs. The degrees of freedom for the paired samples \emph{t}-test is \(N - 1\). Therefore, df = 76.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Locate the test critical value for your paired samples \emph{t}-test}{Locate the test critical value for your paired samples t-test}}\label{locate-the-test-critical-value-for-your-paired-samples-t-test}}

I could look at the \href{https://www.statology.org/t-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} for the \emph{t}-distribution. Because I have non-directional hypotheses, I would use the column for a \emph{p}-value of .05 for a two-tailed test. I roll down to the closest sample size (I'll pick 60). This suggests that my \emph{t}-test statistic would need to be greater than 2.0 in order to be statistically significant.

I can also use the \emph{qt()} function in base R. This function requires that I specify the alpha level (0.05), whether the test is one- or two-tailed (2), and my degrees of freedom (76). Specifying ``TRUE'' and ``FALSE'' after the lower.tail command gives the positive and negative regions of rejection.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

It is not surprising that these values are a smidge lower than 2.0. Why? Because in the table we stopped at df of 60, when it is actually 76.

\hypertarget{what-is-the-confidence-interval-around-the-mean-difference}{%
\subsubsection{What is the confidence interval around the mean difference?}\label{what-is-the-confidence-interval-around-the-mean-difference}}

Here is the formula for hand-calculating the confidence interval.

\[\bar{D}\pm t_{cv}(s_{d}/\sqrt{n})\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\bar{D}\) the mean difference score
\item
  \(t_{cv}\) the test critical value for a two-tailed model (even if the hypothesis was one-tailed) where \(\alpha = .05\) and the degrees of freedom are \(N-1\)
\item
  \(s_{d}\) the standard deviation of \(\bar{D}\)
\item
  \(N\) sample size
\end{itemize}

Let's calculate it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FloatTok{0.12} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ (}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FloatTok{1.991673} \SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ ((}\FloatTok{0.8}\SpecialCharTok{/}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{77}\NormalTok{)))))}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -0.3015778
\end{verbatim}

These values indicate the range of scores in which we are 95\% confident that our true \(\bar{D}\) lies. Stated another way, we are 95\% confident that the true mean difference lies between -0.302 and 0.062. Because this interval crosses zero, we cannot rule out that the true mean difference is 0.00. This result is consistent with our non-significant \emph{p} value. For these types of statistics, the 95\% confidence interval and \emph{p} value will always be yoked together.

Cohen's \emph{d} measures, in standard deviation units, the distance between the two means. Regardless of sign, values of .2, .5, and .8 are considered to be small, medium, and large, respectively.

Because the paired samples \emph{t}-test used the difference score in the numerator, there are two easy options for calculating this effect:

\chapter{One-way ANOVA}\label{oneway}}

\href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtz5cFLQl4KMQZGTX3LI6O4wzJrbZwMnk}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

One-way ANOVA allows the researcher to analyze mean differences between two or more groups on a between-subjects factor. For the one-way ANOVA, each case (i.e., individual, participant) must have scores on two variables: a factor and a dependent variable.

The factor must be categorical in nature, dividing the cases into two or more groups or levels. These levels could be ordered (e.g., placebo, low dose, high dose) or unordered (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, existential, psychodynamic). The dependent variable must be assessed on a quantitative, continuous dimension. The ANOVA \emph{F} test evaluates whether population means on the dependent variable differ across the levels of the factor.

One-way ANOVA can be used in experimental, quasi-experimental, and field studies. As we work through the chapter, we will examine some some of the requirements (assumptions) of the statistic in greater detail.

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-5}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate the statistical assumptions associated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
\item
  Describe the relationship between model/between-subjects and residual/within-subjects variance.
\item
  Narrate the steps in conducting a formal one-way ANOVA beginning with testing the statistical assumptions through writing up an APA style results section.
\item
  Conduct a one-way ANOVA in R (including calculation of effect sizes and follow-up to the omnibus).
\item
  Conduct a power analysis for a one-way ANOVA.
\item
  Produce an APA style results section for one-way ANOVA.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-4}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-4}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Tran et al. \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} vignette has two variables where the authors have conducted one-way ANOVAs. I will demonstrate one (\emph{Accurate}) in this lecture; the second is available as one of the homework options.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a one-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    follow-up (pairwise, planned comparisons, polynomial trends)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables

We are using data that is simulated from a random clinical trial (RCT) conducted by Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}.

The one-way ANOVA examples we are simulating represent the post-only design which investigated three levels of the exceptionalizing stereotype in a sample of Asian American participants. This experimental design involved a confederate (posing as a peer) whose parting comment fell into the low racial loading, high racial loading, or control conditions.

In the article, the one-way ANOVA is a relatively smaller focus. In fact, Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} reported results from two ANOVAs and 4 ANCOVAs, using a pre-test as a covariate. A preprint of their article is available \href{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4146/b528961c041de317c6a4c699f12fc5a4bc22.pdf?_ga=2.179078439.2028716028.1610939782-1660125104.1610939782}{here}. If you are interested in this topic, I highly encourage you to review the more complex analyses and their results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Accurate} is the DV we will be exploring in this lesson. Participants rated how \emph{accurate} they believed their partner's impression of them was (0 = \emph{very inaccurate}, 3 = \emph{very accurate}).
\item
  \textbf{moreTalk} is the DV suggested as a practice problem. Participants rated how much longer they would continue the interaction with their partner compared to their interactions in general (-2 = \emph{much less than average}, 0 = \emph{average}, 2 = \emph{much more than average}).

\subsection{Data Simulation}\label{data-simulation-2}}

Simulating data for a one-way ANOVA requires the sample size (listed first), mean (mean=), and standard deviation (sd=) for each of the groups \citep{crump_simulating_2018}. In creating this simulation, I used the data from Table 1 in the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} article. Having worked the problem several times, I made one change. The group sizes in the original study were 23, 22, and 23. To increase the probability that we would have statistically significant results in our worked example, I increased the sample sizes to 30 for each group. In this way we have a perfectly \emph{balanced} (equal cell sizes) design.

\end{Shaded}

Examining the data is important for several reasons. First, we can begin our inspection for anomalies. Second, if we are confused about what statistic we wish to apply, understanding the characteristics of the data can provide clues.

We can see the entire dataframe by clicking open the dataframe object found in the Environment window of R studio. This will open a tab that allows scrolling up/down and left/right through the entire dataframe. It is also possible to sort by variables.

Alternatively the \emph{head()} function from base R displays a static view of the first six rows of data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  ID COND  Accurate   moreTalk
1  1 High 0.4203896 -0.6398265
2  2 High 1.1226505 -2.0000000
3  3 High 0.8852238 -0.2497750
4  4 High 1.5689439  0.1455637
5  5 High 1.8307196 -0.9960413
6  6 High 1.8874431 -1.0692978
\end{verbatim}

Yet another option is to use the \emph{str()} function from base R. This provides a list of variables and provides detail about their formats.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : chr  "High" "High" "High" "High" ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

If we look at this simple dataset, we see that we see that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{COND} is a grouping variable) with 3 levels (high, low, control)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``chr'' (character) format, it needs to be changed to be a factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Accurate} is a continuous variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``num'' (numerical) format, this is an appropriate format.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{moreTalk} is a continuous variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``num'' (numerical) format, this is an appropriate format
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are many ways to convert variables to factors; here is one of the simplest.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#convert variable to factor}
\NormalTok{accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's recheck the structure

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : Factor w/ 3 levels "Control","High",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

By default, R orders factors alphabetically. This means, analyses will assume that ``Control'' (C) is the lowest condition, then ``High,'' then ``Low.'' Since these have theoretically ordered values, we want them in the order of ``Control,'' ``Low,'' ``High.''

Here is the script to create an ordered factor. The order in which the variables are entered in the concatenated list (``c'') establishes the order (e.g., levels).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# ordering the factor}
\NormalTok{accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND, }\AttributeTok{levels =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Control"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Low"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"High"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Again, we can check our work.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#another structure check}
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : Factor w/ 3 levels "Control","Low",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

Now our variables are suitable for analysis.

Although you may continue working with the simulated data, at this point, you may wish to export and/or import the data as a .csv (think ``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object that preserves the information about the variables -- such changing COND to an ordered factor). Here is the code to do so. The data should save in the same folder as the .rmd file. Therefore, it is really important (think, ``good R hygiene'') to have organized your folders so that your .rmd and data files are co-located.

I have hashtagged out the code. If you wish to use it, delete the hashtags. Although I show the .csv code first, my personal preference is to save R data as .rds files. While they aren't easy to ``see'' as an independent file, they retain the formatting of the variables. For a demonstration, refer back to the \protect\hyperlink{Ready}{Ready\_Set\_R} lesson.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(accSIM30,}
\CommentTok{\# file=\textquotesingle{}accSIM.csv\textquotesingle{}, sep=\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring}
\CommentTok{\# back the simulated dat from a .csv file acc\_csv \textless{}{-}}
\CommentTok{\# read.csv(\textquotesingle{}accSIM.csv\textquotesingle{}, header = TRUE)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you have cleared the environment and then imported the .csv file, examining the structure of the .csv file shows that the prior formatting is lost. This is demonstrated in the accompanying screencast.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# a quick demo to show that the .csv format loses the variable}
\CommentTok{\# formatting str(acc\_csv)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Below is the code to write and then import the data as an .rds file.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# to save the df as an .rds (think \textquotesingle{}R object\textquotesingle{}) file on your computer;}
\CommentTok{\# it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working}
\CommentTok{\# with saveRDS(accSIM30, \textquotesingle{}accSIM.rds\textquotesingle{}) bring back the simulated dat}
\CommentTok{\# from an .rds file acc\_RDS \textless{}{-} readRDS(\textquotesingle{}accSIM.rds\textquotesingle{})}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By examining the structure of the .rds file we can see that the .rds file preserves the variable formatting. This is demonstrated in the accompanying screencast.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# a quick demo to show that the .rds format preserves the variable}
\CommentTok{\# formatting str(acc\_RDS)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that I renamed each of these data objects to reflect the form in whic I saved them (i.e., ``acc\_csv'', ``acc\_RDS''). If you have followed this step, you will want to rename the file before continuing with the rest of the chapter. Alternatively, you can start from scratch, re-run the code to simulate the data, and skip this portion on importing/exporting data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#accSIM30 \textless{}{-} acc\_RDS}
\CommentTok{\#or}
\CommentTok{\#accSIM30 \textless{}{-} acc\_csv}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{quick-peek-at-the-data-3}{%
\subsection{Quick Peek at the Data}\label{quick-peek-at-the-data-3}}

This lesson's exploration of the data is designed to introduce multiple tools for doing so. In this first demonstration I will quickly produce a mean and standard deviation using functions from base R.

The \emph{aggregate()} function lets R know we want output by a grouping variable. We then list the variable of interest, a tilda (I think of the word ``by''), and then the grouping variable (I think ``Accurate by COND''). Finally we list the dataframe and the statistic (e.g., mean or standard deviation). R is case sensitive -- so check your capitalization if your code fails to execute.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{aggregate}\NormalTok{(Accurate }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ COND, accSIM30, mean)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     COND Accurate
1 Control 1.756195
2     Low 1.900116
3    High 1.152815
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{aggregate}\NormalTok{(Accurate }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ COND, accSIM30, sd)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

1 Control 0.4603964
2     Low 0.6301138
3    High 0.6587486
\end{verbatim}

Inspection of the means and standard deviations shows that the racially loaded \emph{high} condition has the lowest accuracy score (\(M = 1.153\)) and the largest variability (\(SD = 0.659\)).

Graphing data is a best practice for early exploration and inspection of the data. In ANOVA models the boxplot is especially useful. The \emph{ggpubr} package offers terrific options. After calling \emph{ggpubr::ggboxplot()}, we list the data frame and name the x and y variables. That would be sufficient to produce a simple boxplot. The ``add = jitter'' command will plot each individual case, but ``jitter'' them to the right and left such that they are not overlapping and we can see all scores. For fun I added some color.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ggpubr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{ggboxplot}\NormalTok{(accSIM30, }\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"COND"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Accurate"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{add =} \StringTok{"jitter"}\NormalTok{,}
    \AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"COND"}\NormalTok{, )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{07-OnewayANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf} In boxplots the center value is the median. The box spans the \emph{interquartile range} and ranges from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The whiskers cover 1.5 times the interquartile range. When this does not capture the entire range, outliers are represented with dots.

From both the boxplot and the linegraph with error bars, we can see that participants in the low racial loading condition have the highest accuracy ratings. This is followed by the control and then high racial loading conditions. Are these differences statistically significant? This is why we need the one-way ANOVA.

\hypertarget{working-the-oneway-anova-by-hand}{%
\section{Working the Oneway ANOVA (by hand)}\label{working-the-oneway-anova-by-hand}}

ANOVA was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. The name is a bit of a misnomer -- rather than analyzing \emph{variances}, we are investigating differences in \emph{means} (but the formula does take variances into consideration\ldots stay tuned).

ANOVA falls squarely within the tradition of \textbf{null hypothesis significance testing} (NHST). As such, a formal, traditional, ANOVA begins with statements of the null and alternate hypotheses. \emph{Note. In their article, Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} do not list such. This is farly common in present-day journal articles.}

In our example, we would hypothesize that the population means (i.e., Asian or Asian American individuals in the U.S.) are equal: \[H_{O}: \mu _{1} = \mu _{2} = \mu _{3}\] There are an number of ways that the \(H_{O}\) could be false. Here are a few: \[H_{a1}: \mu _{1} \neq \mu _{2} \neq \mu _{3}\] \[H_{a2}: \mu _{1} = \mu _{2} > \mu _{3}\] \[H_{a3}: \mu _{1} > \mu _{2} > \mu _{3}\] The bottom line is that if we have a statistically significant omnibus ANOVA (i.e., the test of the overall significance of the model) and the \(H_{O}\) is false, somewhere between the three levels of the grouping factor, the means are statistically significantly different from each other.

In evaluating the differences between means, one-way ANOVA compares:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  systematic variance to unsystematic variance
\item
  explained to unexplained variation
\item
  experimental effect to the individual differences
\item
  model variance to residual variance
\item
  between group variance to within group variance
\end{itemize}

The ratio of these variances is the \emph{F}-ratio.

Navarro \citeyearpar{navarro_book_2020} offers a set of useful figures to compare between- and within-group variation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{07-OnewayANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-16}Graphical illustration of ``between groups'' variation}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{07-OnewayANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-17}Graphical illustration of ``within groups'' variation}
\end{figure}

When between-group variance (i.e,. model variance) is greater than within-group variance (i.e., residual variance) there may be support to suggest that there are statistically significant differences between groups.

Let's examine how variance is partitioned by hand-calculating sums of squares total, model, and residual. Along the way we will use some basic R skills to manipulate the data.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-total}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Total}\label{sums-of-squares-total}}

Sums of squares total represents the total amount of variance within our data. Examining the formula(s; there are variants of each) can help us gain a conceptual understanding of this.

In this first version of the formula we can see that the grand (or overall) mean is subtracted from each individual score, squared, and then summed. This makes sense: \emph{sums of squares, total}.

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\] In the next version of the formula we see that the sums of square total is the addition of the sums of squares model and residual.

\[SS_{T}= SS_{M} + SS_{R}\]

``Between'' and ``within'' are another way to understand ``model'' and ``residual.'' This is reflected in the next formula.

\[SS_{T}= SS_{B} + SS_{W}\] Finally, think of the sums of squares total as the grand variance multiplied by the overall degrees of freedom (\emph{N} - 1).

\[SS_{T}= s_{grand}^{2}(n-1)\] Let's take a moment to \emph{hand-calculate} \(SS_{T}\). Not to worry -- we'll get R to do the math for us!

Our grand (i.e., overall) mean is

\begin{Shaded}

Subtracting the grand mean from each Accurate rating yields a mean difference. In the script below I have used the \emph{mutate()} function from the \emph{dplyr} package (a part of the \emph{tidyverse}) to created a new variable ('' m\_dev'') in the dataframe. The \emph{tidyverse} package is one of the few exceptions that I will open via the library. This is because we need it if we are going to use the pipe (\%\textgreater\%) to string parts of our script together.

Unless you run the script at the top of this document (``options(scipen=999)''), R will (seemingly selectively) use \textbf{scientific e notation} to report your results. The proper value is one where the base number (before the ``e'') is multiplied by 10, raised to the power shown: \(3.830065 * 10^{17}\) Another way to think of it is to move the decimal 17 places to the left. In any case, this number is essentially zero.

Back to the point of sums of squares total, the sum of deviations around the grand mean will always be zero. To make them useful, we must square them:

If we sum the squared mean deviations we will obtain the total variance (sums of squares total):

This value, the sum of squared deviations around the grand mean, is our \(SS_T\). The associated \emph{degrees of freedom} is \(N - 1\); in our case this is 90-1 = 89.

In one-way ANOVA, we divide \(SS_T\) into \textbf{model/between sums of squares} and \textbf{residual/within sums of squares}.

The \emph{model} generally represents the notion that the means are different than each other. We want the variation between our means to be greater than the variation within each of the groups from which our means are calculated.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-for-the-model-or-between}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares for the Model (or Between)}\label{sums-of-squares-for-the-model-or-between}}

We just determined that the total amount of variation within the data is 39.678 units. From this we can estimate how much of this variation our model can explain. \(SS_M\) tells us how much of the total variation can be explained by the fact that different data points come from different groups.

We see this reflected in the formula below, where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the grand mean is subtracted from each group mean
\item
  this value is squared and multiplied by the number of cases in each group
\item
  these values are summed
\end{itemize}

\[SS_{M}= \sum n_{k}(\bar{x}_{k}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]

To calculate this, we start with the grand mean (previously calculated): 1.603.

We also estimate the group means. The script below provides the formula, the dataset, and the particular statistic (mean) that we want calculated.

This value, \(SS_M\) is the amount of variance accounted for by the model; that is, the the amount of variance accounted for by the grouping variable/factor, COND. Degrees of freedom for \(SS_M\) is always one less than the number of elements (e.g., groups) used in its calculation (\(k-1\)). Because we have three groups, our degrees of freedom for the model is two.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Residual (or within)}\label{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within}}

To recap, we know there are 39.678 units of variation to be explained in our data. Our model explains 9.432 of these units. Sums of squares residual tells us how much of the variation cannot be explained by the model. This value is influenced by extraneous factors; some will refer to it as ``noise.''

Looking at the formula can assist us in with a conceptual formula. In \(SS_R\) we subtract the group mean from each individual member of the group and then square it.

\[SS_{R}= \sum(x_{ik}-\bar{x}_{k})^{^{2}}\] Below is another approach to calculating\(SS_R\). In this one the variance for each group is multiplied by its respective degrees of freedom, then summed.

\[SS_{R}= s_{group1}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group2}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group3}^{2}(n-1))\] Again, the formula is in three chunks -- but this time the calculations are \emph{within-group}. We need the variance (the standard deviation squared) for the calculation.

Our estimates of variation were \emph{sums of squares} and are influenced by the number of scores that were summed. We can correct this bias by calculating their average -- the \emph{mean squares} or \(MS\). We will use these in the calculation of the \(F\) ratio -- the statistic that tests if there are significant differences between groups.

Like the constellation of sums of squares, we calculate mean squares for the model (\(MS_M\)) and residual(\(MS_R\)). Each formula simply divides the corresponding sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom.

\(F = MS_{M}/MS_{R}\) = 13.566

To determine whether or not it is statistically significant, we can check a \href{https://www.statology.org/how-to-read-the-f-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} \citep{zach_how_2019} for the \emph{F} test.

Our example has 2 (numerator) and 87 (denominator) degrees of freedom. Rolling down to the table where \(\alpha = .05\), we can see that any \(F\) value \textgreater{} 3.11 (a value somewhere between 3.07 and 3.15) will be statistically significant. Our \(F\) = 13.566, so we have clearly exceeded the threshold. This is our \emph{omnibus F test}.

We can also use a look-up function, which follows this general form: qf(p, df1, df2. lower.tail=FALSE)

While it is important to follow-up to see where these significant differences lie, we will not do these by hand. Rather, let's rework the problem in R.

\section{Working the One-Way ANOVA with R Packages}\label{working-the-one-way-anova-with-r-packages}}

Let's rework the problem in R. We start at the top of the flowchart, evaluating the statistical assumptions.

\subsection{Evaluating the Statistical Assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-3}}

All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. The one-way ANOVA has four assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dependent variable is normally distributed for each of the populations as defined by the different levels of the factor. We will examine this by

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    evaluating skew and kurtosis
  \item
    visually inspecting the distribution
  \item
    conducting Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality
  \item
    examing a QQ plot
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The variances of the dependent variable are the same for all populations. This is often termed the \emph{homogeneity of variance} assumption. We will examine this with

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Levene's Test
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The cases represent \emph{random} samples from the populations and scores on the test variable are \emph{independent} of each other. That is, comparing related cases (e.g., parent/child, manager/employee, time1/time2) violates this assumption and this question would need to be evaluated by a different statistic such as \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{repeated measures ANOVA} or dyadic data analysis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Independence} in observations is a research design issue. ANOVA is not robust to violating this assumption. When observations are correlated/dependent there is a dramatic increase in Type I error.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The dependent variable is measured on an interval scale.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the dependent variable is categorical, another statistic (such as logistic regression) should be chosen.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Is the dependent variable normally distributed across levels of the factor?}\label{is-the-dependent-variable-normally-distributed-across-levels-of-the-factor}}

From the \emph{psych} package, the \emph{describe()} function can be used to provide descriptive statistics (or, ``descriptives'') of continuously scaled variables (i.e., variables measured on the interval or ratio scale). In this simple example, we can specify the specific continuous, DV.

If we want descriptives for each level of the grouping variable (factor), we can use the \emph{describeBy()} function of the \emph{psych} package. The order of entry within the script is the DV followed by the grouping variable (IV). In our research vignette below, I mentally interpret the \emph{Accurate \textasciitilde{} COND} formula as, ``Accurate by condition.''

Skew and kurtosis are one way to evaluate whether or not data are normally distributed. When we use the ``type=1'' argument, the skew and kurtosis indices in the \emph{psych} package can be interpreted according to Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines. Regarding skew, values greater than the absolute value of 3.0 are generally considered ``severely skewed.'' Regarding kurtosis, ``severely kurtotic'' is argued to be anywhere greater 8 to 20. Kline recommended using a conservative threshold of the absolute value of 10.

The \emph{Shapiro-Wilk} test evaluates the hypothesis that the distribution of the data deviates from a comparable normal distribution. If the test is non-significant (\emph{p} \textgreater.05) the distribution of the sample is not significantly different from a normal distribution. If, however, the test is significant (\emph{p} \textless{} .05), then the sample distribution is significantly different from a normal distribution. The \emph{rstatix} package can conduct this test for us.

\end{verbatim}

The \(p\) values for the distributions of the dependent variable (accurate) in each of the three conditions are all well above .05. This tells us that the Accurate variable does not deviate from a statistically significant distribution at any level (Control, \emph{W} = 0.954, \emph{p} = 0.215; Low, \emph{W} = 0.944, \emph{p} = 0.115`; High, \emph{W} = 0.980, \emph{p} = 0.831).

Especially in the more simple ``ANOVA's'' I like this form of the Shapiro-Wilk test because it makes it clear that we expect normality within each of the grouping levels. This approach, however, is only appropriate when there are a low number of levels/groupings and there are many data points per group. As models become more complex, researchers should use the model-based option for assessing normality. To do this, we first create an object that tests our research model.

Although that model (a regression model) has information about our primary statistic, we are using it to carefully investigate the assumption of normality. One product of the analysis is \emph{residuals}. Residuals are the unexplained variance in the outcome (or dependent) variable after accounting for the predictor (or independent) variable. When we plot these ``leftovers'' against the values of x, we can visualize the fit of the model in a QQ plot. The dots represent the residuals. When they are relatively close to the line they not only suggest good fit of the model, but we know they are small and evenly distributed around zero (i.e., normally distributed).

1 residuals(res_model)     0.979   0.150
\end{verbatim}

These results parallel what we have already learned. That is, the non-significant \emph{p} value associated with the model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicates that our distribution of residuals does not differ from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.979, p = 0.15\)). Given the space restrictions in journal articles and the greater interest in results of the primary analyses, I am more likely to report model-level results than the results from the cell-based Shapiro-Wilk tests.

There are limitations to the Shapiro-Wilk test. As the dataset being evaluated gets larger, the Shapiro-Wilk test becomes more sensitive to small deviations; this leads to a greater probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (null hypothesis being the values come from a normal distribution). Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} advised that ANOVA is relatively robust to violations of normality if there are at least 15 cases per cell and the design is reasonably balanced (i.e., equal cell sizes).

\hypertarget{should-we-consider-removing-outliers}{%
\subsubsection{Should we consider removing outliers?}\label{should-we-consider-removing-outliers}}

If our data pointed to significant violations of normality, we could consider identifying and removing outliers. Removing data is a serious consideration that should not be made lightly. If needed, though, here is a tool to inspect the data and then, if necessary, remove it.

We can think of outlier identification in a couple of ways. First, we might look at dependent variable across the entire dataset. That is, without regard to the levels of the grouping variable. We can point \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} to the data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{accSIM30 }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

[8] is.extreme
<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)
\end{verbatim}

The output ``0 rows'' is not an error. It means if we consider the distribution of the Accurate variable as a whole, there are no outliers. Let's re-run the code, this time requiring it to look within each of the grouping levels of the condition variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{accSIM30 }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

# A tibble: 2 x 8

2 Low   39       0.655   -0.201 -0.948   0.899 TRUE       FALSE     
\end{verbatim}

This output tells us that in the low-racial loading condition there are two cases that are identified as outliers (denoted as TRUE) but not as extreme outliers (denoted as FALSE). Handily, the function returns information (i.e., the values of the Accurate and moreTalk variables, the ID number) that would help us delete it.

Let's say that, after very careful consideration, we decided to remove the case with ID = 31. We could use \emph{dplyr::filter()} to do so. In this code, the \emph{filter()} function locates all the cases where ID = 31. The exclamation point that precedes the equal sign indicates that the purpose is to remove the case.

\begin{Shaded}

\CommentTok{\# accSIM30 \textless{}{-} dplyr::filter (accSIM30, ID != \textquotesingle{}31\textquotesingle{})}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once executed, we can see that this case is no longer in the dataframe. Although I demonstrated this in the accompanying lecture, I have hashtagged out the command because I would not delete the case. If you already deleted the case, you can return the hashtag and re-run all the code up to this point.

The Levene's test evaluates the ANOVA assumption that variances of the dependent variable for each level of the independent variable are similarly distributed. We want this to be non-significant (\(p\) \textgreater{} .05). If violated, we need to use an ANOVA test that is ``robust to the violation of the homogeneity of variance'' (e.g., Welch's oneway).

\end{verbatim}

We write the result of the Levene's as \(F(2, 87) = 1.695, p = 0.190\). Because \(p\) \textgreater{} .05, we know that the result is nonsignficant -- that the variances of the three groups are not statistically significantly different from each other. If the results had been statistically significantly different, we would have needed to use a Welch's \(F\) or robust version of ANOVA.

\hypertarget{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Summarizing results from the analysis of assumptions}\label{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions}}

It is common for an APA style results section to begin with a review of the evaluation of the statistical assumptions. As we have just finished these analyses, I will document what we have learned so far:

\begin{quote}
Regarding the assumption of normality, skew and kurtosis values at each of the levels of the condition value fell well below the thresholds that Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} identified as concerning (i.e., below \textbar3\textbar{} for skew and \textbar10\textbar{} for kurtosis). Similarly, no extreme outliers were identified and results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, indicated that the model residuals did not did differ from a normal distribution \((W = 0.979, p = 0.15)\). Finally, Levene's homogeneity of variance test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption (\(F[2, 87] = 1.695, p = 0.190\)).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{computing-the-omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Computing the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{computing-the-omnibus-anova}}

Having met all the assumptions, we are now ready to calculate the omnibus \(F\) test. \emph{Omnibus} is the term applied to the first \emph{F} test that evaluates if all groups have the same mean \citep{chen_relationship_2018}. If this test is not significant there is no evidence in the data to reject the null; that is, there is no evidence to suggest that group means are different. If it is significant -- and there are three or more groups -- follow-up testing will be needed to determine where the differences lie.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway/OnewayWrkFlw_omnibus.jpg}
\caption{An image of the workflow for one-way ANOVA, showing that we are at the stage of computing the omnibus ANOVA.}
\end{figure}

We will use \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} to calculate the omnibus. In script we must point to the data and provide the formula (Accurate \textasciitilde{} COND). By specifying ``detailed=TRUE'' we get can view our sums of squares values. When we run this test, we will save all of the results in an object. We can name this object anything -- I will call it \emph{omnibus1w}. When we create objects, we have to re-type the name of the object below our formula in order for the results to display. Objects are incredibly useful because we can later use them in follow-up tests, in creating figures, and in exporting results that we can use outside of R (e.g., to create tables for papers or presentations).

\end{verbatim}

The values we see map onto those we calculated by hand. Our \(SS_M\) (9.432) plus \(SS_R\) (30.246) sum to equal the \(SS_T\) (39.678). Dividing the two sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom produces the means squared. Then, dividing the \(MS_M\) (COND) by \(MS_R\) (4.716/0.348) provides the \emph{F} ratio. By using a table of \emph{F} critical values, we already knew that our \emph{F} value exceeded the value in the table of critical values. Here we see that \emph{p} \textless{} .001.

The ``\emph{F} string'' for an APA style results section should be written like this: \(F(2,87) = 13.566, p < .001\).

\hypertarget{effect-size-for-the-one-way-anova}{%
\subsubsection{Effect size for the one-way ANOVA}\label{effect-size-for-the-one-way-anova}}

\textbf{Eta squared} is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the dependent variable/outcome that can be explained in terms of the independent variable/predictor. Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

You may see different values (.02, .13, .26) suggested as small, medium, and large effects -- these values are used when multiple regression is used. A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

The formula for \(\eta^2\) is straightforward. If we think back to our hand-calculations of all the sums of squares, we can see that this is the proportion of variance that is accounted for by the model.

\[\eta ^{2}=\frac{SS_{M}}{SS_{T}}\] Hand calculation, then, is straightforward.:

Luckily, \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} has provided the \(\eta ^{2}\) for us; it is found in the column, \emph{ges}. Using the interpretive criteria suggests that our effect is rather large. We can update our \emph{F} string this way: \(F(2,87) = 13.566, p < .001, \eta ^{2} = 0.238\). An APA style write-up of the omnibus might read like this:

\begin{quote}

\hypertarget{follow-up-to-the-omnibus-f}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Follow-up to the Omnibus \emph{F}}{Follow-up to the Omnibus F}}\label{follow-up-to-the-omnibus-f}}

The \emph{F}-test associated with the one-way ANOVA is the \emph{omnibus} -- giving the result for the overall test. Looking at the workflow for the one-way ANOVA we see that if we had had we had a non-significant \(F\), we would have stopped our analysis.

However, if the omnibus \(F\) is significant, we know that there is at least one pair of cells where there is a statistically significant difference. We have several ways (each with its own strengths/limitations) to figure out where these differences lie.

\hypertarget{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error}{%
\subsubsection{Planning for the management of Type I Error}\label{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error}}

\emph{Type I error} is the concern about false positives -- that we would incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis (i.e., claiming a statistically significant difference when there is not one). In ANOVA, we become increasingly concerned about Type I error as the number of pairwise or post hoc comparison increases. In ANOVA, we generally begin controlling for Type I error when follow-up to a significant omnibus test.

The \emph{traditional Bonferroni} is, perhaps, the most well-known approach to managing Type I error. Although the lessons in this OER will frequently suggest alternative approaches to managing Type I error, I will quickly review it now because it is relatively straightforward and intuitive. We start by establishing the \(\alpha_{family}\); this is traditionally \(p = .05\).

Next, we determine how many pairwise comparisons that we are going to conduct. If we want to conduct all possible comparisons, we could use this formula to determing the number: \(N_{pc}=\frac{N_{g}(N_{g}-1)}{2}\), where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(N_{pc}\) is the number of pairwise comparisons, and
\item
  \(N_{g}\) is the number of groups.
\end{itemize}

In the current research vignette, the COND factor had three levels: control, low, high. Thus, if we wanted to conduct all possible comparisons we would determine \(N_{pc}\) this way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{3}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3{-}1}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

Subsequently, we would compute a new alpha that would be used for each comparison with this formula: \(\alpha_{pc}=\frac{\alpha_{family}}{N_{pc}}\).

In the current research vignette we would calculate it this way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{05}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.01666667
\end{verbatim}

If we were to use the traditional Bonferroni to manage Type I error, the resultant \(p\) value would need to be \textless{} .017 in order for statistical significance to be claimed.

Luckily, the traditional Bonferroni (and other approaches to managing Type I error) has been reverse-engineered so that we do not have to determine the more conservative alpha levels. Rather, when we specify these options in the R script, the \emph{p} value is adjusted and we can continue to use the customary criteria of \(p < .05, p < .01\), and \(p < .001\). In the case of the traditional Bonferonni, the \emph{p} value has been adjusted upward by multiplying it (i.e., the raw \emph{p} values) by the number of comparisons being completed. This holds the \emph{total} Type I error rate across these tests to be \(\alpha = 0.05\).

Although the traditional Bonferroni is easy-to-understand and compute, it has been criticized as being too restrictive. That is, it increases the risk of making a Type II error (i.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). Therefore, as we work through each option for follow-up testing for the ANOVA models, I will introduce one or more methods for managing Type I error that are commonly used with that follow-up. Descriptions of all the methods for managing Type I error that are used in this OER are described in an \protect\hyperlink{type1}{appendix}

\hypertarget{option-1-post-hoc-pairwise-comparisons}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION \#1: Post hoc, pairwise, comparisons}\label{option-1-post-hoc-pairwise-comparisons}}

A very common follow-up to the omnibus test from a one-way ANOVA is to conduct post hoc, pairwise comparisons, of all possible combinations of pairs.

Post hoc, pairwise comparisons are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  used for exploratory work when no firm hypotheses were articulated a priori,
\item
  used to compare the means of all combinations of pairs of an experimental condition,
\item
  less powerful than planned comparisons because more strict criterion for significance should be used.
\end{itemize}

By specifying the \emph{formula} of the ANOVA, the \emph{rstatix::t\_test()} function will provide comparisons of all possible combinations. The arguments in the code mirror those we used for the omnibus. Note that I am saving the results as an object. We will use this object (``ttest'') later when we create an accompanying figure.

We will request the traditional Bonferroni using the \emph{p.adjust.method}. The \emph{rstatix::t\_test()} offers multiple options for adjusting the \emph{p} values.

The \emph{estimate} column provide the mean difference between the two levels of the independent different. The \emph{estimate1/group1} and \emph{estimate2/group2} columns provide those means and identify the group levels. The \emph{statistic} column provides the value of the \emph{t}-test.

The \emph{p} value is the unadjusted \emph{p}-value, it will usually be ``more significant'' (i.e., a lower value) than the \emph{p.adj} value that we specified in our code. The column \emph{p.adj.signif} provides symbolic notation associated with the ``p.adj'' value. In this specific case we specified the traditional Bonferroni as the adjusted \emph{p} value.

An APA style results section of this follow-up might read like this:

\begin{quote}
We followed up the significant omnibus with a series of post hoc, pairwise comparisons. We controlled for Type I error with the traditional Bonferroni adjustment. Results suggested that there were statistically significant differences between the control and high (\(M_{diff} = 0.601, p < .001\)) and low and high (\(M_{diff} = 0.75, p < 0.001\)) conditions, but not control and low conditions (\(M_{diff} = -.14, p = 0.951\)). Consequently, it appeared that only the highest degree of racial loading (e.g., ``You speak English well for an Asian'') resulted in the decreased perceptions of accuracy of impressions from the confederate. Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1 and complete ANOVA results are presented in Table 2. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the results.

Although it would not make a difference in this research vignette, the LSD (least significant differences) method is commonly used for controlling Type I error in the follow-up to a one-way ANOVA. The LSD method is appropriate in the one-way ANOVA scenario when there are only three levels in the factor. In this case, Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} have suggested that alpha could be retained at the alpha level for the ``family'' (\(\alpha_{family}\)), which is conventionally \(p = .05\) and used both to evaluate the omnibus and, so long as they don't exceed three in number, the planned or pairwise comparisons that follow.

\hypertarget{option-2-non-orthogonal-planned-contrast}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION \#2: Non-orthogonal planned contrast}\label{option-2-non-orthogonal-planned-contrast}}

Another option for follow-up to a significant omnibus test is to evaluate \emph{planned} comparisons. These can either be orthogonal (i.e., a complete partitioning of variance) or \emph{non-orthogonal} (i.e., allowing for overlapping variance). We will start with a non-orthogonal example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway/OnewayWrkFlw_planned.jpg}
\caption{An image of the workflow for one-way ANOVA, showing that we are at the following up to a significant omnibus F by conducting planned comparisons}
\end{figure}

Planned comparisons are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  theory-driven comparisons constructed prior to data collection,
\item
  based on the idea of partitioning the variance created by the overall effect of group differences into gradually smaller portions of variance, and
\item
  more powerful than post hoc tests.
\end{itemize}

Planned contrasts involve further considerations regarding the \emph{partitioning of variance.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There will always be \(k-1\) contrasts; in our case this means we will have two contrasts
\item
  Each contrast must involve only two \emph{chunks} of variance.
\end{itemize}

If the researcher chooses this route, they must decide which two comparisons will best tell the story of the data as it relates to the hypotheses and a priori theory. I will compare differences between the no and low racial loading conditions, and then between low and high racial loading conditions. I have chosen to not adjust the \emph{p} values. In the results write-up, I will reference the LSD method as my rationale for this approach.

The format of the output is quite similar to the preceding examples. One difference is that this function does not provide mean differences nor confidence intervals. If I wanted them, I would need to calculate them.

An APA style results section of this follow-up might read like this:

\begin{quote}
We followed up the significant omnibus with two, non-orthogonal, planned comparisons. Because we had fewer than three comparisons, we chose to retain alpha at .05. This is consistent with the LSD method for control of Type I error \citep{green_using_2017}. Results suggested a statistically significant difference between the low and high (\(M_{diff} = 0.75, p < .001\)) conditions, but not between the control and low conditions (\(M_{diff} = -.14, p = 0.347\)). Consequently, it appeared that only the highest degree of racial loading (e.g., ``You speak English well for an Asian'') resulted in the decreased perceptions of accuracy of impressions from the confederate.

\includegraphics{07-OnewayANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-58-1.pdf} In this particular research vignette, I probably would not compute nor report the non-orthogonal option. The statistically significant difference pattern from the post hoc pairwise comparisons (Option 1) was straightforward. Using the non-orthogonal planned comparisons to aid in the control of Type I error way (a) does not change the result (i.e., does not increase the power) and (b) provides a less complete picture of the results.

\hypertarget{option-3-orthogonal-planned-contrasts}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION \#3: Orthogonal planned contrasts}\label{option-3-orthogonal-planned-contrasts}}

\emph{Orthogonal} contrasts are even more sophisticated. Essential to conducting an orthogonal contrast is the requirement that if a group is singled out in one comparison it should be excluded from subsequent contrasts. The typical, orthogonal scenario with three ordered groups has only two contrasts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Control versus the combined low and high conditions
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  because control was excluded, it should not reappear in the next contrast
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Low versus high
\end{enumerate}

Especially in scenarios where there are no, low and high dose (or exposure) conditions, this is an elegant comparison. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the \emph{rstatix} package does not offer a function to make these computations. We can, however, use functions from base R. Given that \emph{rstatix} is a wrapper for the \emph{aov()} function in base R, the code should feel somewhat familiar.

To work toward our orthogonal contrasts, we first need to create an object (``omnibus1w\_b'') from a one-way ANOVA test using the base R, \emph{aov()} function. You can see that the script involves the same elements as in \emph{rstatix}. We can view the results byusing the \emph{summary()} function.

The values on the row labeled \emph{intercept} are the values of the baseline or comparison group. Since CONDLow and CONDHigh follow, we know the three groups are sensibly ordered as control (0), low (1), and high (2).

While we are here, we observe that the control mean is 1.76 and that this value is statistically significantly different than zero. The \emph{CONDLow} row represents the low level of the condition variable. The mean for ``low'' is 0.14 units bigger than the control group and this is not a statistically significant difference (\(p = 0.347\)). The third row is the high level of the condition variable. This value is 0.60 units lower than the control condition and is statistically significantly different than zero (\(p < .001\)). This information is consistent with what we have already learned.

To move forward with the orthogonal contrasts we must first specify our contrasts.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Specifying the contrasts means you know their order within the factor
\item
  Early in the data preparation, we created an ordered factor with Control, Low, High as the order.
\item
  We want orthogonal contrasts, this means there will be

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{k} - 1 contrasts; with three groups we will have two contrasts
  \item
    once we single out a condition for comparison, we cannot use it again.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In \emph{contrast1} we compare the control condition to the combined low and high conditions. In \emph{contrast2} we discard the control condition (it was already singled out) and we compare the low and high conditions.

This is sensible because we likely hypothesize that any degree of racially loaded stereotypes may have a deleterious outcome, so we first compare control to the two conditions with any degree of racial loading. Subsequently, we compare the low and high levels of the factor.

In the second step we must bind the contrasts together and check the output to ensure that we've mapped them correctly.

These planned contrasts show that when the control condition is compared to the combined low and high racial loading conditions, there is not a statistically significant difference, \emph{t}(87) = -1.742, \emph{p} = 0.085. However, when the low and high racial loading conditions are compared, there is a statistically significant difference, \emph{t}(87) = -4.909, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. An APA style results write-up might look like this:

\begin{quote}
We followed the significant omnibus test with a pair of orthogonal contrasts. The first compared the control condition to the combined low and high racial loading conditions. The result was non-significant (\(t[87] = -1.742, p = 0.085\)). The second contrast compared the low and high racial loading conditions. In this contrast, accuracy ratings were statistically significantly lower for the high racial loading condition (\(t[87] = -4.909, p < 0.001\)).
\end{quote}

At this point, I do not have script that would update the \emph{ggpubr} graph with these results. If I were to use this follow-up in my APA style results, I would likely use the boxplot we produced at the beginning of the lesson.

\hypertarget{option-4-trend-polynomial-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION \#4: Trend (polynomial) analysis}\label{option-4-trend-polynomial-analysis}}

Polynomial contrasts let us see if there is a linear (or curvilinear) pattern to the data. To detect a trend, the data must be coded in an ascending order\ldots and it needs to be a sensible comparison. Here's where this would fall in our workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway/OnewayWrkFlw_poly.jpg}
\caption{An image of the workflow for one-way ANOVA, showing that we are at the following up to a significant omnibus F by assessing for a polynomial trend}
\end{figure}

To detect a trend, the data must be coded in an ascending order and the comparison needs to be sensible and theoretically defensible. Our data has a theoretically ordered effect (control/none, low, and high racially loaded conditions). Recall that we created an ordered factor when we imported the data. However, we can use use the \emph{contrasts()} function from base R to verify the order.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{contrasts}\NormalTok{(accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND)}

\begin{verbatim}

Control        -2         0
Low             1        -1
High            1         1
\end{verbatim}

In a polynomial analysis, the statistical analysis looks across the ordered means to see if they fit a linear or curvilinear shape that is one fewer than the number of levels (i.e., \(k-1\)). Because the COND factor has three levels, the polynomial contrast checks for linear (.L) and quadratic (one change in direction) trends (.Q). If we had four levels, \emph{contr.poly()} could also check for cubic change (two changes in direction). Conventionally, when more than one trend is significant, we interpret the most complex one (i.e., quadratic over linear).

To the best of my knowledge, \emph{rstatix} does not offer these contrasts. We can fairly easily make these calculations in base R by creating a set of polynomial contrasts. In the prior example we specified our contrasts through coding. Here we can the \emph{contr.poly(3)} function. The ``3'' lets R know that there are three levels in COND. The \emph{aov()} function will automatically test for quadratic (one hump) and linear (straight line) trends.

Results of our polynomial contrast suggested statistically significant results for both linear \(t(87) = -3.963 , p < .001\) and quadratic \(t(87) = -3.380, p = .001\) trends. A quick peek back at any of our boxplots illustrates the quadratic trend (an small increase in accuracy from control to low; a larger decrease in accuracy from low to high) that was supported by this analysis.

Given that our earlier analyses did not support statistically significant differences between control and low racial loading conditions, I am disinclined to include this information. That said, there are times when I will include results of a polynomial trend along with the results of posthoc or planned pairwise comparisons. I will do this when the overall trend in the data helps clarify the results. For example, if in a circumstance where there was a clear linear trend between no, low, and high dose conditions and the pairwise results were consistent with that (i.e., statistically significant differences between no and low, no and high, low and high), I would likely add the results of the polynomial, after presenting the results of the posthoc or planned comparisons:

\begin{quote}
Additionally, results of a polynomial constrasted suggested a statistically significant linear trend across the three conditions, \(t(87) = -3.963 , p < .001\).
\end{quote}

At this point, I do not have script that would update the \emph{ggpubr} figure in a manner that would clearly convey these results. If I were to use this follow-up in my APA style results, I would likely use the simple boxplot we produced at the beginning of the lesson.

\hypertarget{which-set-of-follow-up-tests-do-we-report}{%
\subsubsection{Which set of follow-up tests do we report?}\label{which-set-of-follow-up-tests-do-we-report}}

It depends! Here are some things to consider.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the post hoc comparisons are robustly statistically significant (and controlling Type I error is not going to change that significance), I would lean toward reporting those.
\item
  If \emph{p} values are hovering around 0.05, an orthogonal contrast will offer more power because

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a \emph{k} - 1 comparison will be more powerful and
  \item
    (when the research design allows) the contrast of no dose/exposure to any exposure followed by a contrast between low and high doses/exposures is compelling.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The polynomial can be a useful descriptive addition if there is a linear or quadratic relationship that is sensible or interesting.
\end{itemize}

Although I would report either the post hoc or planned contrasts, I will sometimes add a polynomial if it clarifies the result (i.e., there is a meaningful linear or curvilinear pattern essential to understanding the data).

\subsection{What if we Violated the Homogeneity of Variance test?}\label{what-if-we-violated-the-homogeneity-of-variance-test}}

The \emph{rstatix::welch\_anova\_test} produces Welch's \emph{F} -- a test that is robust to violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption. The Welch's approach adjusts the residual degrees of freedom used to produce the Welch's \emph{F}-ratio. The format of the argument is quite similar to what we have been doing all along.

\end{verbatim}

Note that the denominator \emph{df} is now 56.34 (not 87) and \emph{p} value is a little larger (it was 0.00000745). With its design intended to avoid making a Type I error, the Welch's \emph{F} is more restrictive. While it wouldn't alter the conclusions in our research vignette, it could if the \emph{p} value was closer to 0.05. These are some of the tradeoffs we must consider in order to have confidence in the results. At this time the \emph{rstatix::welch\_anova\_test()} function does not offer an effect size. The omega squared is an effect size that is commonly reported with the Welch's \emph{F}. It would either need to be calculated by hand or with another R package.

In terms of follow-up to the omnibus test, \emph{rstatix} includes Games-Howell pairwise comparisons and pairwise t-tests. Neither of these follow-up options requires the assumption of equal variance. Consequently either could be used as a follow-up. Here's an example from the Games-Howell test.

Another common correction for evaluating the omnibus test when there is a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption is the Brown and Forsythe \emph{F}-ratio. The \emph{rstatix} package does not include this option (but other packages do).

\hypertarget{apa-style-results-3}{%
\section{APA Style Results}\label{apa-style-results-3}}

All that's left to do to decide which set of follow-up tests to report and assemble the write-up. APA style results sections in empirical manuscripts are typically accompanied by tables and figures. APA style discourages redundancy in information (i.e., if information is clearly presented in a table, do not repeat it verbatim in written text) and encourages reducing the cognitive load of the reader. For this example, I suggest two tables -- (a) one with means and standard deviations the dependent variable (disaggregated by level)and (b) a second that reports the output from the one-way ANOVA.

The package \emph{apaTables} can produce journal-ready tables. Deciding what to report in text and table is important. First, I create Table 1 with means and standard deviations (plus a 95\% confidence interval around each mean).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# table.number = 1 assigns a table number to the top of the table}

\begin{verbatim}

    High 1.15 [0.91, 1.40] 0.66

Note. M and SD represent mean and standard deviation, respectively.
LL and UL indicate the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval 
for the mean, respectively. 
The confidence interval is a plausible range of population means that could 
have caused a sample mean (Cumming, 2014). 
\end{verbatim}

Next, I create Table 2 with source table for the one-way ANOVA. The result can be edited in Microsoft Word for the paper or presentation (e.g., I would replace the partial-eta squared with \(\eta^2\)). One trick about \emph{apaTables::aov} is that it requires an object from the base R's \emph{aov} function. Recall that we used this in our contrasts. None-the-less, I will repeat it in this code.

\end{verbatim}

Regarding figures, I would use the one I created with the set of follow-up results.

With table and figure at hand, here is how I would write up these results:

\begin{quote}
A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the relationship between degree of racial loading of an exceptionalizing microaggression and the perceived accuracy of a research confederate's impression of the Asian or Asian American participant. The independent variable, condition, included three levels: control/none, low, and high levels of racial loading.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Regarding the assumption of normality, skew and kurtosis values at each of the levels of the condition value fell well below the thresholds that Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} identified as concerning (i.e., below \textbar3\textbar{} for skew and \textbar10\textbar{} for kurtosis). Similarly, no extreme outliers were identified and results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, indicated that the model residuals did not did differ from a normal distribution \((W = 0.979, p = 0.15)\). Finally, Levene's homogeneity of variance test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption (\(F[2, 87] = 1.695, p = 0.190\)).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant effect of COND on accuracy perception \((F[2,87] = 13.566, p < .001, \eta ^{2} = 0.238\)). We followed up the significant omnibus with a series of post hoc, pairwise comparisons. We controlled for Type I error with the traditional Bonferroni adjustment. Results suggested that there were statistically significant differences between the control and high (\(M_{diff} = 0.601, p < .001\)) and low and high (\(M_{diff} = 0.75, p < 0.001\)) conditions, but not control and low conditions (\(M_{diff} = -.14, p = 0.951\)). Consequently, it appeared that only the highest degree of racial loading (e.g., ``You speak English well for an Asian'') resulted in the decreased perceptions of accuracy of impressions from the confederate. Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1 and complete ANOVA results are presented in Table 2. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the results.

\hypertarget{power-analysis}{%
\section{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis}}

Power analysis allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Utilized another way, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. If the probability is unacceptably low, we may want to revise or stop. A helpful overview of power as well as guidelines for how to use the \emph{pwr} package can be found at a \href{https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{Quick-R website} \citep{kabacoff_power_2017}.

There are four interrelating elements of power:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample size, \emph{N}
\item
  Effect size,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For one-way ANOVAs, Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Significance level = P(Type I error),

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recall that Type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis (a false positive).
  \item
    Stated another way, Type I error is the probability of finding an effect that is not there.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Power = 1 - P(Type II error),

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recall that Type II error is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis (a false negative).
  \item
    Power is the probability of finding an effect that is there.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If we have any three of these values, we can calculate the fourth.

In Champely's \emph{pwr} package, we can conduct a power analysis for a variety of designs, including the balanced one-way ANOVA (i.e., roughly equal cell sizes) design that we worked in this chapter.

The \emph{pwr.anova.test()} has five parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{k} = \# groups
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size
\item
  \emph{f} = effect sizes, where 0.1/small, 0.25/medium, and 0.4/large

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the absence from an estimate from our own data, we make a guess about the expected effect size value based on our knowledge of the literature
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{sig.level} = \emph{p} value that you will use
\item
  \emph{power} = .80 is the standard value
\end{itemize}

In the script below, we simply add our values. So long as we have four values, the fifth will be calculated for us.

Because this calculator requires the effect size in the metric of Cohen's \emph{f} (this is not the same as the \emph{F} ratio), we need to convert it. The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function.

      sig.level = 0.05

This result suggested that we would need 11 people per group.

If we were unsure about what to expect in terms of our results, we could take a guess. I like to be on the safe(r) side and go with a smaller effect. What would happen if we had a Cohen's \emph{f} that represented a small effect?

Doctoral student (and student in one of my classes) Emi Ichimura and I were able to interview the first author (Alisia Tran, PhD) about the article and what it means. Here's a direct \href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=643f8a1e-bb6d-4ceb-a860-aeba01522528}{link} to that interview.

Among others, we asked:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What were unexpected challenges to the research method or statistical analysis?
\item
  What were the experiences of the confederates as they offered the statements in teh racial loading conditions? And in the debriefings, did the research participants share anything more anecdotally in their experiences as research participants?
\item
  What are your current ideas about interventions or methods for mitigating the harm caused by racial microaggressions?
\item
  How do you expect the article to change science, practice, and/or advocacy?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{practice-problems-5}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-5}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. The data for each vignette should have at least three levels in the independent variable. Further, at least one of the problems you work should have a significant omnibus test so that follow-up is required.

Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  testing the statistical assumptions
\item
  conducting a one-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    follow-up (pairwise, planned comparisons, polynomial trends)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  writing a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

Additionally, please complete at least one set of \emph{hand calculations}, that is use the code demonstrated in the chapter to work through the formulas that compute the one-way ANOVA. At this stage in your learning, you may ignore any missingness in your dataset by excluding all rows with missing data in your variables of interest.

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.}}

If one-way ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(2021)'' from 2021 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.

There are other ways to change the dataset. For example, if you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller. If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.

In their study, Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} included an outcome variable where participants rated how much longer they would continue the interaction with their partner compared to their interactions in general. The scale ranged from -2 (\emph{much less than average}) through 0 (\emph{average}) to 2 (\emph{much more than average}). This variable is available in the original simulation and is an option for a slightly more challenging analysis.

Please have at least 3 levels for the predictor variable.

I want to ask the question, do course evaluation ratings for traditional pedagogy differ for students as we enacted a substantive revision to our statistics series. The evaluative focus is on the ANOVA course and we will compare ratings from the stable, transition, and resettled stages of the transitional period. The variable (Stage) of interest will have three levels:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  STABLE: 2017 represents the last year of ``stability during the old way'' when we taught with SPSS and during the 2nd year of the doctoral programs.
\item
  TRANSITION: 2018 \& 2019 represent the transition to R, when the classes were 30\% larger because each of the IOP and CPY departments were transitioning to the 1st year (they did it separately, so as not to double the classes)
\item
  RESETTLED: 2020 \& 2021 represent the ``resettled'' phase where the transition to R was fairly complete and the class size returned to normal because the classes were offered in the first year.
\end{itemize}

This is not a variable that was included in the dataset posted to the OSF repository, so we will need to create it.

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could create a different subset of data. I worked the example for students taking the ANOVA class. You could choose multivariate or psychometrics. You could also choose a different dependent variable. I chose the traditional pedagogy subscale. Two other subscales include socially responsive pedagogy and valued by the student.}

Let's first create the ``Stage'' variable that represents the three levels of transition.

The ProgramYear variable contains the information I need, but the factor labels are not intuitive. Let me remap them.

Let's check the structure:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The TradPed (traditional pedagogy) variable is an average of the items on that scale. I will first create that variable.

\end{verbatim}

We'll use Kline's (2016) threshholds of the absolute values of 3 (skew) and 10 (kurtosis). The highest absolute value of skew is -0.881; the highest absolute value of kurtosis is -0.629. These are well below the areas of concern.

the Shapiro-wilk test is a formal assessment of normality. It is a 2-part test that begins with creating an ANOVA model from which we can extract residuals, then testing the residuals.

\end{verbatim}

The Shapiro-Wilk test suggests that the our distribution of residuals is statistically significantly different from a normal distribution \((W = 0.941, p < .001)\).

It is possible to plot the residuals to see how and where they deviate from the line.

\textbf{Should we remove outliers?}

The \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function identifies outliers and extreme outliers.

3 Transition     1.4       TRUE      FALSE
4 Transition     1.6       TRUE      FALSE
\end{verbatim}

There are 4 cases identified with outliers; none of those is extreme. I also notice that these outliers are low course evaluations. It seems only fair to retain the data from individuals who were not satisfied with the course.

\textbf{Are the variances of the dependent variable similar across the levels of the grouping factor?}

We want the results of the Levene's homogeneity of variance test to be non-significant. This would support the notion that the TradPed variance is equivalent across the three stages of the transition.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rstatix}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{levene\_test}\NormalTok{(OneWay\_df, TradPed }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ Stage)}

1     2   109      4.52 0.0130
\end{verbatim}

The non-significant \emph{p} value suggests that the variances across the three stages are not statistically significantly different: \(F(2, 109) = 4.523, p = 0.013\).

Before moving on, I will capture our findings in an APA style write-up of the testing of assumptions:

\begin{quote}
Regarding the assumption of normality, skew and kurtosis values at each of the levels of program year fell well below the thresholds that Kline (2016a) identified as concerning (i.e., below \textbar3\textbar{} for skew and \textbar10\textbar{} for kurtosis). In contrast, results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, indicated that the model residuals differed from a normal distribution \((W = 0.941, p < .001)\). Although 4 outliers were identified none were extreme, thus we retained all cases. Finally, Levene's homogeneity of variance test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \(F(2, 109) = 4.523, p = 0.013\). ANOVA is relatively robust to this violation when there are at least 15 cases per cell and the design is balanced (i.e., equivalent cell sizes). While we have at least 15 cases per cell, we have a rather unbalanced design. We will need to keep this limitation in mind as we interpret the results.

The one-way ANOVA is statistically significant. This means that there should be at least one statistically significant difference between levels of the design. Before moving on, I will capture the \emph{F} string: \(F(2, 109) = 7.199, p = 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.117\). Regarding the effect size, values of .01, .07, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large. The value of .11 would be medium-to-large.

The post hoc tests suggested statistically significant differences between the stable transition resettled stages, favoring the stable period of time (i.e., using SPSS and taught in the second year).

We used the Bonferroni. The Bonferroni divides the overall alpha (.05) by the number of comparisons (3). In this case, a \emph{p} value woul dhave to be lower than 0.017 to be statistically significant. The calulation reverse-engineers this so that we can interpret the \emph{p} values by the traditional. 0.05. In the output, it is possible to see the higher threshholds necessary to claim statistical significance.

A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effects of significant transitions (e.g., from SPSS to R; to the second to the first year in a doctoral program) on students ratings of traditional pedagogy.

Regarding the assumption of normality, skew and kurtosis values at each of the levels of program year fell well below the thresholds that Kline (2016a) identified as concerning (i.e., below \textbar3\textbar{} for skew and \textbar10\textbar{} for kurtosis).

\begin{quote}
Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a statistically significant effect of stage on students assessments of traditional pedagogy, \(F(2, 109) = 7.199, p = 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.117\). The effect size was medium-to-large. We followed up the significant omnibus with all possible pairwise comparisons. We controlled for Type I error with the traditional Bonferroni adjustment. Results suggested that there were statistically significant differences between the stable and transition stages \((Mdiff = 0.655, p = 0.003)\), but not between stable and resettled \((Mdiff = 0.267,p = 0.324)\) or transition and resettled \((Mdiff= -0.388,p = 0.217)\) stages. Given that the doctoral programs are unlikely to transition back to SPSS or into the second year, the instructor(s) are advised to consider ways that could result in greater student satisfaction. Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1 and complete ANOVA results are presented in Table 2. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the results.

Because this calculator requires the effect size in the metric of Cohen's \emph{f} (this is not the same as the \emph{F} ratio), we need to convert it. The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.3640094
\end{verbatim}

We simply plug this value into the ``f =''.

First let's ask what our level of power was? Our goal would be 80\%.

Given that our design was unbalanced (21, 44, 47 across the three stages), I used 38 (114/3).

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

              k = 3
              n = 38
              f = 0.3640094
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.9395967

NOTE: n is number in each group
\end{verbatim}

Our power was 0.94. That is, we had 94\% chance to find a statistically significant result if one existed. In the next power analysis, let's see what sample size is recommended.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pwr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{pwr.anova.test}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{k =} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{f =} \FloatTok{0.3640094}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sig.level =} \FloatTok{0.05}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{power =} \FloatTok{0.8}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.8

NOTE: n is number in each group
\end{verbatim}

In order to be at 80\% power to find a statistically significant result if there is one, we would need only 25 people per group. We currently had an unbalanced design of 50, 41, 21.

\subsection{Hand Calculations}\label{hand-calculations-4}}

Before we continue:

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. This is because the formula we have used for the hand-calculations utilizes an approach to calculating the sums of squares that presumes that we have a balanced design (i.e., that the cell sizes are equal). When cell sizes are unequal (i.e., an unbalanced design) the Type II package in \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} may produce different result.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in ANOVA models. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of ANOVA, we would take more time to understand what is occurring. My goal is to provide you with enough of an introduction to ANOVA that you would be able to explore further which sums of squares type would be most appropriate for your unique ANOVA model.

Regarding the evaluation of traditional pedgagoy across three stages of transitions to a doctoral ANOVA course, the null hypothesis predicts no differences between the three levels of the dependent variable:

\[H_{O}: \mu _{1} = \mu _{2} = \mu _{3}\]

In contrast, the alternative hypothesis suggests there will be differences. Apriorily, I did not make any specific predictions.

\[H_{a1}: \mu _{1} \neq \mu _{2} \neq \mu _{3}\]

In this (somewhat long and complex) lesson we conduct a 3X2 ANOVA. We will

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Work an actual example from the literature.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``by hand'', and
  \item
    with R packages
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I will also demonstrate

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    several options for exploring interaction effects, and
  \item
    several options for exploring main effects.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Exploring these options will allow us to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Gain familiarity with the concepts central to multi-factor ANOVAs.
  \item
    Explore tools for analyzing the complexity in designs.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The complexity is that not all of these things need to be conducted for every analysis. The two-way ANOVA Workflow is provided to help you map a way through your own analyses. I will periodically refer to this map so that we can more easily keep track of where we are in the process.

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-6}}

There is about 1 hour and 30 minutes hours of lecture. If you work through the materials with me plan for another two hours of study.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-6}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-6}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define, locate, and interpret all the effects associated with two-way ANOVA:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    main
  \item
    interaction (introducing the concept, \emph{moderator})
  \item
    simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Identify which means belong with which effects. Then compare and interpret them.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    marginal means
  \item
    individual cell means
  \item
    comparing them
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Map a process/workflow for investigating a factorial ANOVA
\item
  Manage Type I error
\item
  Conduct a power analysis to determine sample size
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-5}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-5}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select from options that vary in degree of difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} article has two dependent variables (DVs; negative and positive evaluation) which are suitable for two-way ANOVAs. I will demonstrate a simulation of one of their 3X2 ANOVAs (negative) in this lecturette. The second dependent variable (positive) is suggested for the moderate level of difficulty.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\section{Introducing Factorial ANOVA}\label{introducing-factorial-anova}}

My approach to teaching is to address the conceptual as we work problems. That said, there are some critical ideas we should address first.

\textbf{ANOVA is for experiments} (or arguably closely related designs). As we learn about the assumptions you'll see that ANOVA has some rather restrictive ones (e.g., there should be an equal/equivalent number of cases per cell). To the degree that we violate these assumptions, we should locate alternative statistical approaches where these assumptions are relaxed.

\textbf{Factorial}: a term used when there are two or more independent variables (IVs; the factors). The factors could be between-groups, within-groups, repeated measures, or a combination of between and within.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Independent factorial design}: several IVs (predictors/factors) and each has been measured using different participants (between groups).
\item
  \textbf{Related factorial design}: several IVs (factors/predictors) have been measured, but the same participants have been used in all conditions (repeated measures or within-subjects).
\item
  \textbf{Mixed design}: several IVs (factors/predictors) have been measured. One or more factors uses different participants (between-subjects) and one or more factors uses the same participants (within-subjects). Thus, there is a cobination of independent (between) and related (within or repated) designs.
\end{itemize}

``Naming'' the ANOVA model follows a number/levels convention. The example in this lesson is a 3X2 ANOVA. We know there are two factors that have three and two levels, respectively:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{rater ethnicity} has three levels representing the two ethnic groups that were in prior conflict (Marudese, Dayaknese) and a third group who was uninvolved in the conflict (Javanese);
\item
  \emph{photo stimulus} has two levels representing members of the two ethnic groups that were in prior conflict (Madurese, Dayaknese);
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Moderator} is what creates an interaction. Below are traditional representations of the \emph{statistical} and \emph{conceptual} figures of interaction effects. We will say that Factor B, \emph{moderates} the relationship between Factor A (the IV) and the DV.

In a later lesson we work an ANCOVA -- where we will distinguish between a \emph{moderator} and a \emph{covariate.} In lessons on regression models, you will likely be introduced to the notion of \emph{mediator.}

\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-5}}

The research vignette for this example was located in Kalimantan, Indonesia and focused on bias in young people from three ethnic groups. The Madurese and Dayaknese groups were engaged in ethnic conflict that spanned 1996 to 2001. The last incidence of mass violence was in 2001 where approximately 500 people (mostly from the Madurese ethnic group) were expelled from the province. Ramdhani et al.'s \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} research hypotheses were based on the roles of the three ethnic groups in the study. According to the author, the Madurese were viewed as the transgressors when they occupied lands and took employment and business opportunities from the Dayaknese. Ramdhani et al.~also included a third group who were not involved in the conflict (Javanese). The research participants were students studying in Yogyakara who were not involved in the conflict. They included 39 Madurese, 35 Dyaknese, and 37 Javanese; 83 were male and 28 were female.

In the study \citep{ramdhani_affective_2018}, participants viewed facial pictures of three men and three women (in traditional dress) from each ethnic group (6 photos per ethnic group). Participant were asked, ``How do you feel when you see this photo? Please indicate your answers based on your actual feelings.'' Participants responded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicated ratings of higher intensity on that scale. The two scales included the following words:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Positive: friendly, kind, helpful, happy
\item
  Negative: disgusting, suspicious, hateful, angry
\end{itemize}

For two-way ANOVA our variables need to be properly formatted. In our case:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Negative is a continuously scaled DV and should be \emph{num}
\item
  Positive is a continuously scaled DV and should be \emph{num}
\item
  Rater should be an unordered factor
\item
  Photo should be an unordered facor
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(Ramdhani\_df)}

\begin{verbatim}
## 'data.frame':    111 obs. of  5 variables:

Our Negative variable is correctly formatted. Let's reformat Rater and Photo to be factors and re-evaluate the structure. R's default is to order the factors alphabetically. In this case this is fine. If we had ordered factors such as dosage (placebo, lo, hi) we would want to respecify the order.

If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv (``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

\section{Working the Factorial ANOVA (by hand)}\label{working-the-factorial-anova-by-hand}}

Before we work an ANOVA let's take a moment to consider what we are doing and how it informs our decision-making. This figure (which already contains ``the answers'') may help conceptualize how variance is partitioned.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/partition.png}
\caption{Image of a flowchart that partitions variance from sums of squares totals to its component pieces}
\end{figure}

As in one-way ANOVA, we partition variance into \textbf{total}, \textbf{model}, and \textbf{residual}. However, we now further divide the \(SS_M\) into its respective factors A(column), B(row,) and their a x b product.

In this, we begin to talk about main effects and interactions.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-total-1}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Total}\label{sums-of-squares-total-1}}

Our formula is the same as it was for one-way ANOVA:

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\] Let's calculate it for the Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} data. Our grand (i.e., overall) mean is

This value, 114.775, the sum of squared deviations around the grand mean, is our \(SS_T\); the associated \emph{degrees of freedom} is \(N\) - 1.

In factorial ANOVA, we divide \(SS_T\) into \textbf{model/between} sums of squares and \textbf{residual/within} sums of squares.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-for-the-model}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares for the Model}\label{sums-of-squares-for-the-model}}

\[SS_{M}= \sum n_{k}(\bar{x}_{k}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]

The \emph{model} generally represents the notion that the means are different than each other. We want the variation between our means to be greater than the variation within each of the groups from which our means are calculated.

In factorial ANOVA, we need means for each of the combinations of the factors. We have a 3 x 2 model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rater with three levels: Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese
\item
  Photo with two levels: Dayaknese, Madurese

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within-1}{%

\(SS_R\) is error associated with within group variability. If people are randomly assigned to conditions there should be no other confounding variable. Thus, all \(SS_R\) variability is \emph{uninteresting} for the research and treated as noise.

\[SS_{R}= \sum(x_{ik}-\bar{x}_{k})^{^{2}}\] Here's another configuration of the same:

\[SS_{R}= s_{group1}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group2}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group3}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group4}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group5}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group6}^{2}(n-1))\]

Again, the formula is in six chunks -- but this time the calculations are \emph{within-group}. We need the variance (the standard deviation squared) for the calculation. We can retrieve these from the descriptive statistics.

\hypertarget{interpreting-the-results}{%
\subsection{Interpreting the results}\label{interpreting-the-results}}

What have we learned?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there is a main effect for Rater
\item
  there is a main effect for Photo
\item
  there is a significant interaction effect
\end{itemize}

In the face of this significant interaction effect, we would follow-up by investigating the interaction effect. Why? The significant interaction effect means that findings (e.g., the story of the results) are more complex than group identity or photo stimulus, alone, can explain.

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. This is because the formula we have used for the hand-calculations utilizes an approach to calculating the sums of squares that presumes that we have a balanced design (i.e., that the cell sizes are equal). When cell sizes are unequal (i.e., an unbalanced design) the Type II package in \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} will produce different result.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in ANOVA models. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of ANOVA, we would take more time to understand what is occurring. My goal is to provide you with enough of an introduction to ANOVA that you would be able to explore further which sums of squares type would be most appropriate for your unique ANOVA model.

All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. I have marked our Two-Way ANOVA Workflow with a yellow box outlined in red to let us know that we are just beginning the process of analyzing our data with an evaluation of the statistical assumptions.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

The are four critical assumptions in factorial ANOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cases represent random samples from the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is an issue of research design
  \item
    Although we see ANOVA used (often incorrectly) in other settings, ANOVA was really designed for the random clinical trial (RCT).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Scores on the DV are independent of each other.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is an issue of research design
  \item
    With correlated observations, there is a dramatic increase of Type I error
  \item
    There are alternative statistics designed for analyzing data that has dependencies (e.g., repeated measures ANOVA, dyadic data analysis, multilevel modeling)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The DV is normally distributed for each of the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    that is, data for each cell (representing the combinations of each factor) is normally distributed
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Population variances of the DV are the same for all cells

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When cell sizes are not equal, ANOVA not robust to this violation and cannot trust F ratio
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Even though we position the evaluation of assumptions first -- some of the best tests of the assumptions use the resulting ANOVA model. Because of this, I will quickly run the model now. I will not explain the results until after we evaluate the assumptions.

Let's start by analyzing \textbf{skew} and \textbf{kurtosis}. Skew and kurtosis are one way to evaluate whether or not data are normally distributed. When we use the ``type=1'' argument, the skew and kurtosis indices in \emph{psych:describe} (or \emph{psych::describeBy}) can be interpreted according to Kline's \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} guidelines. Regarding skew, values greater than the absolute value of 3.0 are generally considered ``severely skewed.'' Regarding kurtosis, ``severely kurtotic'' is argued to be anywhere greater the absolute values of 8 to 20. Kline recommended using a conservative threshold of the absolute value of 10.

Using guidelines from Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} our values for skewness fall below \textbar3.0\textbar{} and our values for kurtosis fall below \textbar10\textbar.

\hypertarget{are-the-model-residuals-normally-distributed}{%
\paragraph{Are the model residuals normally distributed?}\label{are-the-model-residuals-normally-distributed}}

We can further investigate normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The assumption requires that the distribution be normal in each of the levels of each factor. In the case of multiple factors (such as is the case in factorial ANOVA), the assumption requires a normal distribution in each combination of these levels (e.g., Javanese rater of Dyaknese photo). In this lesson's 3 x 2 ANOVA, there are six such combinations. This cell-level analysis has been demonstrated in \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA} and independent \protect\hyperlink{tIndSample}{t-test} lessons. To the degree that there are many factorial combinations (and therefore, cells), this approach becomes unwieldy to calculate, interpret, and report. The cell-level analysis of normality is also only appropriate when there are a low number of levels/groupings and there are many data points per group. Thus, as models become more complex, researchers turn to the model-based option for assessing normality. To do this, we first create an object that tests our research model.

Just a paragraph or two earlier, I ran the factorial ANOVA and saved the results in an object. Among the information contained in that object are \emph{residuals}. Residuals are the unexplained variance in the outcome (or dependent) variable after accounting for the predictor (or independent) variable. In the code below we extract the residuals (i.e., that which is left-over/unexplained) from the model. We can examine their distribution with a plot.

\begin{Shaded}

Next, we can take a ``look'' them with a couple of plots.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{08-FactorialANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-1.pdf}

So far so good -- our distribution of \emph{residuals} (i.e., what is leftover after the model is applied) resembles a normal distribution.

The Q-Q plot provides another view. The dots represent the residuals. When they are relatively close to the line they not only suggest good fit of the model, but we know they are small and evenly distributed around zero (i.e., normally distributed).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{qqnorm}\NormalTok{(resid\_neg)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{08-FactorialANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-39-1.pdf}

Additionally, we can formally test the distribution of the residuals with a Shapiro test. We want the associated \emph{p} value to be greater than 0.05.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{shapiro.test}\NormalTok{(resid\_neg)}

## 
##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  resid_neg
## W = 0.98464, p-value = 0.2344
\end{verbatim}

Whooo hoo! \(p > 0.05\). This means that our distribution of residuals is not statistically significantly different from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.985, p = 0.234\)).

\hypertarget{are-there-outliers}{%
\paragraph{Are there outliers?}\label{are-there-outliers}}

If our data pointed to significant violations of normality, we could consider identifying and removing outliers. Removing data is a serious consideration that should not be made lightly. If needed, though, here is a tool to inspect the data and then, if necessary, remove it.

We can think of outlier identification in a couple of ways. First, we might look at dependent variable across the entire dataset. That is, without regard to the levels of the grouping variable. We can point \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} to the data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Ramdhani\_df }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
\NormalTok{    rstatix}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{identify\_outliers}\NormalTok{(Negative)}

##   is.extreme
## 1      FALSE
\end{verbatim}

Our results indicate that one case (ID = 73) had an outlier (TRUE), but it was not extreme (FALSE).

Let's re-run the code, this time requiring it to look within each of the grouping levels of the condition variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Ramdhani\_df }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

## # A tibble: 3 x 9

\end{verbatim}

This time there are three cases where there are outliers (TRUE), but they are not extreme (FALSE). Handily, the function returns information about each row of data. We can use such information to help us delete it.

Let's say that, after very careful consideration, we decided to remove the case with ID = 18. We could use \emph{dplyr::filter()} to do so. In this code, the \emph{filter()} function locates all the cases where ID = 18. The exclamation point that precedes the equal sign indicates that the purpose is to remove the case.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Ramdhani\_df \textless{}{-} dplyr::filter(Ramdhani\_df, ID != \textquotesingle{}18\textquotesingle{})}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once executed, we can see that this case is no longer in the dataframe. Although I demonstrated this in the accompanying lecture, I have hashtagged out the command because I would not delete the case. If you already deleted the case, you can return the hashtag and re-run all the code up to this point.

Here's how I would summarize our data in terms of normality:

\begin{quote}
Factorial ANOVA assumes that the dependent variable is normally is distributed for all cells in the design. Skew and kurtosis values for each factorial combinations fell below the guidelines recommended by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}. That is, they were below the absolute values of 3 for skew and 10 for kurtosis. Similarly, no extreme outliers were identified and results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that model residuals did not differ significantly from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.9846, p = 0.234\)).
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Are the variances of the dependent variable similar across the levels of the grouping factors?}\label{are-the-variances-of-the-dependent-variable-similar-across-the-levels-of-the-grouping-factors}}

We can evaluate the homogeneity of variance test with the Levene's test for the equality of error variances. Levene's requires a \emph{fully saturated model.} This means that the prediction model requires an interaction effect (not just two, non-interacting predictors). We can use the \emph{rstatix::levene\_test()}. Within the function we point to the dataset, then specify the formula of the factorial ANOVA. That is, predicting Negative from the Rater and Photo factors. The asterisk indicates that they will also be added as an interaction term.

\end{verbatim}

Levene's test, itself, is an \emph{F}-test. Thus, its reporting assumes the form of an \emph{F}-string. Our result has indicated a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption (\(F[5, 105] = 8.634, p < .001)\). This is not surprising as the boxplots displayed some widely varying variances.

Should we be concerned? Addressing violations of homogeneity of variance in factorial ANOVA is complex. The following have been suggested:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One approach is to use different error variances in follow-up to the omnibus. Kassambara \citeyearpar{kassambara_anova_nodate} suggested that separate one-way ANOVAs for the analysis of simple main effects will provide these separate error terms.
\item
  Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} indicated that we should become more concerned about the trustworthiness of the \emph{p} values from the omnibus two-way ANOVA when this assumption is violated and the cell sizes are unequal. In today's research vignette, our design is balanced (i.e., the cell sizes are quite similar).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions-1}{%

It is common for an APA style results section to begin with a review of the evaluation of the statistical assumptions. As we have just finished these analyses, I will document what we have learned so far:

\begin{quote}
Factorial ANOVA assumes that the dependent variable is normally is distributed for all cells in the design. Skew and kurtosis values for each factorial combinations fell below the guidelines recommended by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}.

Results of Levene's test for equality of error variances indicated a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption, (\(F[5, 105] = 8.834, p < .001\)). Given that cell sample sizes were roughly equal and greater than 15, each \citep{green_using_2017} we proceded with the two-way ANOVA.

\subsection{Evaluating the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{evaluating-the-omnibus-anova}}

The \emph{F}-tests associated with the two-way ANOVA are the \emph{omnibus} -- providing the result for the main and interaction effects.

Here's where we are in the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_Omnibus.jpg}
\caption{Image of our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

When we run the two-way ANOVA we will be looking for several effects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main effects for each predictor, and
\item
  the interaction effect.
\end{itemize}

It is possible that all effects will be significant, none will be significant, or some will be significant. The interaction effect always takes precedence over the main effect because it lets us know there is a more nuanced/complex result.

In the code below, the \emph{type} argument is used to specify the type of sums of squares that are used. Type II is the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()}'s default and is what I will use in this demonstration. It will yield identical results as \emph{type=1} when data are balanced (i.e., cell sizes are equal). In specifying the ANOVA, order of entry matters if you choose \emph{type=1}. In that case, if there are distinctions between independent variable and moderator, enter the independent variable first because it will claim the most variance. I provide more information on these options related to types of sums of squares calculations near the end of the chapter.

Let's write the \emph{F strings} from the above table.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rater main effect: \(F[2, 105] = 8.098, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.134\)
\item
  Photo stimulus main effect: \(F[1, 105] = 19.346, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.156\)
\item
  Interaction effect: \(F[2, 105] = 5.696, p = 0.004, \eta ^{2} = 0.098\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Eta squared} (represented in the ``ges'' column of ouput) is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the DV/outcome variable that can be explained in terms of the IVs/predictors. Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

You may see different values (.02, .13, .26) offered as small, medium, and large -- these values are used when multiple regression is used. A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

The formula for \(\eta ^{2}\) is straightforward:

\[\eta ^{2}=\frac{SS_{M}}{SS_{T}}\]

Before moving to follow-up, an APA style write-up of the omnibus might read like this:

\begin{quote}
Computing sums of squares with a Type II approach, the results for the ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for ethnicity of the rater (\(F[2, 105] = 8.098, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.134\)), a significant main effect for photo stimulus, (\(F[1, 105] = 19.346, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.156\)), and a significant interaction effect (\(F[2, 105] = 5.696, p = 0.004, \eta ^{2} = 0.098\)).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{follow-up-to-a-significant-interaction-effect}{%
\subsection{Follow-up to a Significant Interaction Effect}\label{follow-up-to-a-significant-interaction-effect}}

In factorial ANOVA we are interested in main effects and interaction effects. When the result is explained by a main effect, then there is a consistent trend as a function of a factor (e.g., Madurese raters had consistently higher Negative evaluations, irrespective of stimulus). In an interaction effect, the results are more complex (e.g., the ratings across the stimulus differed for the three groups of raters).

There are a variety of strategies to follow-up a significant interaction effect. In this lesson, I demonstrate the two I believe to be the most useful in the context of psychologists operating within the scientist-practitioner-advocacy context. I provide additional examples in the \protect\hyperlink{moRe}{appendix}.

When an interaction effect is significant (irrespective of the significance of one or more main effects), examination of \textbf{simple main effects} is a common statistical/explanatory approached that is used. The Two-Way ANOVA Workflow shows where we are in this process. Our research vignette is a 3 x 2 ANOVA. The first factor, ethnicity, has three levels (Dayaknes, Javanese, Madurese) and the second factor, photo stimulus, has two levels (Dayaknese, Madurese). When we conduct simple main effects, we evaluate one factor within the levels of the other factor. The number of levels in each factor changes the number of steps (i.e., the complexity) in the analysis.

When I am analyzing the simple main effect of photo stimulus (two levels) within ethnicity of the rater (three levels), I only need a one-step procedure that will conduct pairwise comparisons of the negative evaluating of the photo stimulus for the Dayaknese, Javanese, and Madurese raters, separately (while controlling for Type I error). Traditionally, researchers will follow with three, separate, one-way ANOVAs. However, any procedure (e.g., t-tests, pairwise comparisons) that will make these pairwise comparisons is sufficient.

When I am analyzing the simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater (three levels) within photo stimulus (two levels), I will need a two-step process. The first step will require the one-way ANOVA to determine, first, if there were statistically significant differences within the photo stimulus (e.g., Were there differences between Dayaknese, Javanese, and Madurese raters when viewing the Dayaknese photos?). If there were statistically significant differences, we follow up with an analysis of pairwise comparisons.

Although I will demonstrate both rater ethnicity within photo stimulus and photo stimulus within rater ethnicity in this lesson, we will choose only one for the write-up of results.

\hypertarget{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error-1}{%
\subsubsection{Planning for the management of Type I Error}\label{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error-1}}

Controlling for Type I error can depend, in part, on the design of the follow-up tests that are planned, and the number of pairwise comparisons that follow.

In the first option, the examination of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within ethnicity of rater results in only three pairwise comparisons. In this case, I will use the traditional Bonferroni. Why? Because there are only three post omnibus analyses, its more restrictive control is less likely to be problematic.

In the second option, the examination of the simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within photo stimulus results in the potential comparison of six pairwise comparisons. If we used a traditional Bonferroni and divided .05/6, the \emph{p} value for each comparison would need to be less than 0.008. Most would agree that this is too restrictive.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

The Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017} offers a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/6 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

If we were to hand-calculate the Holms, we would rank order the \emph{p} values associated with the six comparisons in order from lowest (e.g., 0.000001448891) to highest (e.g., 1.000). The first \emph{p} value is evaluated with the most strict criterion (.05/6; the traditional Bonferonni approach). Then, each successive comparison calculates the \emph{p} value by using the number of \emph{remaining} comparisons as the denominator (e.g., .05/5, .05/4, .05/3). As the \emph{p} values increase and the alpha levels relax, there will be a cut-point where remaining comparisons are not statistically significant. Luckily, most R packages offer the Holm's sequential Bonferroni as an option. The algorithm in the package rearranges the mathematical formula and produces a \emph{p} value that we can interpret according to the traditional values of \(p < .05, p < .01\) and \(p < .001\). I will demonstrate use of Holm's in the examination of the simple main effect of ethnicity of rater within photo stimulus.

\hypertarget{option-1-the-simple-main-effect-of-photo-stimulus-within-ethnicity-of-the-rater}{%
\subsubsection{Option \#1 the simple main effect of photo stimulus within ethnicity of the rater}\label{option-1-the-simple-main-effect-of-photo-stimulus-within-ethnicity-of-the-rater}}

In the examination of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within ethnicity of the rater our goal is to compare the:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dayaknese raters' negative evaluation of the Dayaknese and Madurese photos,
\item
  Javanese raters' negative evaluation fo the Dayaknese and Madurese photos, and
\item
  Madurese raters' negative evaluation of the Dayaknese and Madurese photos.
\end{itemize}

Thus, we only need three, pairwise comparisons. I will demonstrate two ways to conduct these analyses. Here's where we are in the two-way ANOVA workflow

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlo_IntSmp1.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow -- analysis of simple main effects of factor A within levels of factor B.}
\end{figure}

Separate one-way ANOVAs are a traditional option for this evaluation. Using \emph{dplyr::group\_by()} we can efficiently calculate the three ANOVAs by the grouping variable, Rater. One advantage of separate one-way ANOVAs is that they each have their own error term and that this can help mitigate problems associated with violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \citep{kassambara_anova_nodate}.

Note that in this method there is no option for controlling Type I error. Thus, we would need to do it manually. The traditional Bonferroni involves dividing family-wise error (traditionally \(p < .05\)) by the number of follow-up comparisons. In our case \(.05/3 = .017\).

The APA style write-up will convey what we have found using this traditional approach:

\begin{quote}
To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within the ethnicity of the rater. That is, with separate one-way ANOVAs (chosen, in part, to mitigate violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \citep{kassambara_anova_nodate}) we examined the effect of the photo stimulus within the Dayaknese, Madurese, and Javanese groups. To control for Type I error across the three simple main effects, we set alpha at .017 (.05/3). Results indicated significant differences for Dayaknese (\(F [1, 33] = 50.404, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.604\)) and Javanese ethnic groups \((F [1, 35] = 17.183, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.329)\), but not for the Madurese ethnic group \((F [1, 37] < 0.001, p = .993, \eta ^{2} < .001)\). As illustrated in Figure 1, the Dayaknese and Javanese raters both reported stronger negative reactions to the Madurese. The differences in ratings for the Madurese were not statistically significantly different. In this way, the rater's ethnic group moderated the relationship between the photo stimulus and negative reactions.
\end{quote}

The \emph{rstatix::emmeans\_test()} offers an efficient alternative to this pairwise analysis that will (a) automatically control for Type I error and (b) integrate well into a figure. Note that this function is a wrapper to functions in the \emph{emmeans} package. If you haven't already, you will need to install the \emph{emmeans} package. For each, the resulting test statistic is a \emph{t.ratio}. The result of this \emph{t}-test will be slightly different than an independent sample \emph{t}-test because it is based on \emph{estimated marginal means} (i.e., means based on the model, not directly on the data). We will spend more time with estimated marginal means in the ANCOVA lesson.

In the script below, we will group the dependent variable by Rater and then conduct pairwise comparisons. Note that I have requested that that the traditional Bonferroni be used to manage Type I error. We can see these adjusted \emph{p} values in the output.

Not surprisingly, our results are quite similar. I would report them this way:

\begin{quote}
To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within the ethnicity of the rater. Specifically, we conducted pairwise comparisons between the groups using the estimated marginal means. We specified the Bonferroni method for managing Type I error. Results suggested statistically significant differences differences for the Dayaknese (\(M_diff = -1.312, t[105] = -4.461, p < 0.001\)) and Javanese ethnic groups (\(M_diff = -0.941, t[105] = -3.291, p < 0.001\)) but not for the Madurese ethnic group (\(M_diff = 0.003, t[105] = 0.0121, p = 0.990\)). As illustrated in Figure 1, the Dayaknese and Javanese raters both reported stronger negative reactions to the Madurese. The differences in ratings for the Madurese were not statistically significantly different. In this way, the rater's ethnic group moderated the relationship between the photo stimulus and negative reactions.
\end{quote}

Because we used the \emph{rstatix} functions, we can easily integrate them into our \emph{ggpubr::ggboxplot()}. Let's first re-run the version of the boxplot where ``Rater'' is on the x-axis (and, is therefore our grouping variable). Because I want the data to be as true-to-scale as possible, I have added the full range of the y axis through the \emph{ylim} argument. In order to update the ggboxplot, we will need to save it as an option. My object name represents the ``PHoto within Ethnicity'' simple main effect.

  Dayaknese, Javanese, and Madurese negative evaluations of the Dayaknese photos, and

Consequently, we will need a two-staged evaluation. First, we will conduct separate one-way ANOVAs. Second, we will follow-up with pairwise comparisons.

Results suggest that there are differences within the Dayaknese group, yet because there are three groups, we cannot know with certainty where there are statistically significant difference.

Very consistent with the one-way ANOVAs, we see that there were significant rater differences in the evaluation of the Dayaknese photo, but not for the Madurese photo. Further, in the rating of the Dayaknese photo, there were statistically significant differences between all three comparisons of ethnic groups. The \emph{p}-values remained statistically significant with the adjustment of the Holm's.

For a quick demonstration of differences in managing Type I error, I wil replace ``holm'' with ``bonferroni.'' Here, we will see the more restrictive result, where one of the previously significant comparisons drops out. Note that I am not saving this results as an object -- I don't want it to interfere with our subsequent analyses

Here's how I would update the APA style reporting of results:

\begin{quote}
To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within the photo stimulus. We began with separate one-way ANOVAs (chosen, in part, to mitigate violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \citep{kassambara_anova_nodate}). To control for Type I error across the two simple main effects, we set alpha at .025 (.05/2). Results indicated significant differences for Dayaknese photo (\(F [2, 51] = 13.325, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.343\)) but not for the Madurese photo \((F [2, 54] = 0.679, p = 0.512, \eta ^{2} = 0.025)\). We followed up significant one-way ANOVA with pairwise comparisons between the groups using the estimated marginal means. We specified the Holm's sequential Bonferroni for managing Type I error. Regarding evaluation of the Dayaknese photo, results suggested statistically significant differences in all combinations of raters. As shown in Figure 1, the Dayaknese raters had the lowest ratings, followed by Javanese raters, and then Madurese raters. Consistent with the non-significant one-way ANOVA evaluating ratings of the Madurese photo, there were no statistically significant differences for raters. Results of these tests are presented in Table 1.
\end{quote}

There are seemingly infinite approaches to analyzing significant interaction effects. I am frequently asked, ``But what about \_\_\_\_\_?'' And ``Do you have an example of \_\_\_\_?'' In prior versions of this lesson, I included a few more examples in this section of follow-up to a significant interaction effect. However, in an effort to reduce the cognitive load of the chapter and stay focused on the primary learning goals I have relocated some of these to the \protect\hyperlink{moRe}{appendix} At the time of this update, there are worked examples that highlight:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Orthogonal contrast-coding
\item
  All possible post hoc comparisons
\item
  Polynomial trends
\end{itemize}

If, as a reader, you have recommendations for more specific examples, please suggest them using the contact information provided at the beginning of the OER.

\hypertarget{investigating-main-effects}{%
\subsection{Investigating Main Effects}\label{investigating-main-effects}}

We now focus on the possibility that there might be significant main effects, but a non-significant interaction effect. We only interpret main effects when there is a non-significant interaction effect. Why? Because in the presence of a significant interaction effect, the main effect will not tell a complete story. If we didn't specify a correct model, we still might have an incomplete story. But that's another issue.

Here's where we are on the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WayWrkFlw_Main.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

Recall that main effects are the \emph{marginal means} -- that is the effects of factor A \emph{collapsed across} all the levels of factor B.

If the main effect has only two levels (e.g., the ratings of the Dayaknese and Madurese photos):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the comparison was already ignoring/including all levels of the rater ethnicity factor (Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese),
\item
  it was only a comparison of two cells (Dayaknese rater, Madurese rater), therefore
\item
  there is no need for further follow-up.
\end{itemize}

In the case of our specific research vignette, we learned from the omnibus test that the Photo main effect was statistically significant (\(F[1, 105] = 19.346, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.156\)).This means that we know there are statistically significant differences between ratings of Dayaknese and Madurese photos overall.

\end{verbatim}

A quick review of the descriptive statistics, aggregated by photo stimulus indicates that, overall, Madurese photos were evaluated more negatively.

If the main effect has three or more levels (e.g,. ethnicity of rater with Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese levels), then we follow-up with one or more of the myriad of options. I tend to focus on three:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  planned contrasts
\item
  posthoc comparisons (all possible cells)
\item
  polynomial
\end{itemize}

From our omnibus evaluation, our rater main effect was \(F[2, 105] = 8.098, p < .001, \eta ^{2} = 0.134\). I will demonstrate how to do each as follow-up to a \emph{pretend} scenario where a main effect (but not the interaction effect) had been significant. In fact, our follow-up of Rater main effects will be quite similar to the manner in which we followed up the significant omnibus in the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA lesson}.

Here's what would happen if we simply ran a one-way ANOVA.

Results of a one-way ANOVA evaluating negative reaction to photos of members of Dayaknese and Madurese ethnic groups indicate a statistically differences as a function of the ethnicity of the rater (\(F[2, 108] = 6.426, p = 0.002, \eta^2 = 0.106\))

A boxplot representing this main effect may help convey how the main effect of Rater (collapsed across Photo) is different than an interaction effect.

\hypertarget{option-1-post-hoc-paired-comparisons}{%
\subsubsection{Option \#1 post hoc paired comparisons}\label{option-1-post-hoc-paired-comparisons}}

An easy possibility is to follow-up with all possible post hoc pairwise comparisons. Here is a reminder of our location on the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/wfMain_PH.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow: Following up a significant main effect with post hoc comparisons.}
\end{figure}

Post hoc, pairwise comparisons are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  used for exploratory work when no firm hypotheses were articulated a priori,
\item
  used to compare the means of all combinations of pairs of an experimental condition, and
\item
  less powerful than planned comparisons because more strict criterion for significance should be used.
\end{itemize}

By specifying the \emph{formula} of the ANOVA, the \emph{rstatix::t\_test()} function will provide comparisons of all possible combinations. The arguments in the code mirror those we used for the omnibus. Note that I am saving the results as an object. We will use this object (``ttest'') later when we create an accompanying figure.

We will request the traditional Bonferroni using the \emph{p.adjust.method}. The \emph{rstatix::t\_test()} offers multiple options for adjusting the \emph{p} values.

The \emph{estimate} column provide the mean difference between the two levels of the independent different. The \emph{estimate1/group1} and \emph{estimate2/group2} columns provide those means and identify the group levels. The \emph{statistic} column provides the value of the \emph{t}-test.

The \emph{p} value is the unadjusted \emph{p}-value, it will usually be ``more significant'' (i.e., a lower value) than the \emph{p.adj} value associated with the strategy for managing Type I error that we specified in our code. The column \emph{p.adj.signif} provides symbolic notation associated with the \emph{p.adj} value. In this specific case we specified the traditional Bonferroni as the adjusted \emph{p} value.

An APA style results section of this portion of follow-up might read like this:

\begin{quote}
We followed significant the rater main effect with a series of post hoc, pairwise comparisons. We controlled for Type I error with the traditional Bonferroni adjustment. Results suggested that there were statistically significant differences between the Dayaknese and Javanese (\(M_{diff} = -0.515, p = 0.035\)) and Dayaknese and Madurese (\(M_{diff} = -0.807, p =< 0.003\)) raters, but not Javanese and Madurese rater (\(M_{diff} = -0.292, p = 0.642\)). This analysis disregards the ethnic identity displayed on the photo.
\end{quote}

Below is an augmentation of the figure that appeared at the beginning of the chapter. We can use the objects from the omnibus tests (named, ``omnibus2w'') and post hoc pairwise comparisons (``RaterMain\_ttest'') to add the ANOVA string and significance bars to the figure. Although they may not be appropriate in every circumstance, such detail can assist the figure in conveying maximal amounts of information.

\hypertarget{option-2-planned-orthogonal-contrasts}{%
\subsubsection{Option \#2 planned orthogonal contrasts}\label{option-2-planned-orthogonal-contrasts}}

We generally try for \emph{orthogonal} contrasts so that the partitioning of variance is independent (clean, not overlapping). Planned contrasts are a great way to do this. Here's where we are in the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/wfMain_Plnd.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow: Followup to a significant main effect with planned comparisons.}
\end{figure}

If you aren't extremely careful about your order-of-operations in R, it can confuse objects, so I have named these contrasts \emph{c1} and \emph{c2} to remind myself that they refer to the main effect of ethnicity of the rater.

In this hypothetical scenario (remember we are pretending we are in the circumstance of a non-significant interaction effect but a significant main effect), I am:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  comparing the DV for the Javanese rater to the combined Dayaknese and Madurese raters (c1).
\item
  comparing the DV for the Dayaknese and Madurese raters (c2).
\end{itemize}

These are orthogonal because:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there are \emph{k} - 1 comparisons, and
\item
  once a contrast is isolated (i.e., the Javanese rater in contrast \#1) it cannot be used again

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The ``cake'' analogy can be a useful mnemonic: once you take out a piece of the cake, you really can't put it back in
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

I am not aware of \emph{rstatix} functions or arguments that can complete these analyses. Therefore, we will use functions from base R. It helps to know what the default contrast codes are; we can get that information with the \emph{contrasts()} function.

\begin{Shaded}

## Javanese         1        0
## Madurese         0        1
\end{verbatim}

Next, we set up the contrast conditions. In the code below,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  c1 indicates that the Javanese (noted as -2) are compared to the combined ratings from the Dayaknese (1) and Madurese (1)
\item
  c2 indicates that the Dayaknese (-1) and Madurese (1) are compared; Javanese (0) is removed from the contrast.

With this output we can confirm that, in contrast 1 (the first column) we are comparing the Javanese to the combined Dayaknese and Madurese. In contrast 2 (the second column) we are comparing the Dayaknese to the Madurese.

These planned contrasts show that when the Javanese raters are compared to the combined Dayaknese and Madurese raters, there was a non significant difference, \(t(108) = -0.567, p = 0.572\). However, there were significant differences between Dayaknese and Javanese raters, \(t(108) = 3.556, p < 0.001\).

An mini APA style reporting of these results might look like this:

\begin{quote}

\subsubsection{Option \#3 trend/polynomial analysis}\label{option-3-trendpolynomial-analysis}}

Polynomial contrasts let us see if there is a linear (or curvilinear) pattern to the data. To detect a trend, the data must be coded in an ascending order\ldots and it needs to be a sensible comparison. Here's where this would fall in our workflow.

\includegraphics{images/factorial/wfMain_Poly.jpg} Because these three ethnic groups are not \emph{ordered} in the same way as would an experiment involving dosage (e.g,. placebo, lo dose, hi dose), evaluation of the polynomial trend is not really justified (even though it is statistically possible). None-the-less, I will demonstrate how it is conducted.

The polynomial fits linear and curvilinear trends across levels of a factor based on how the variable is coded in R. The \emph{contrasts()} function from base R will reveal ths ordering. Not surprisingly, this is the same order seen in our boxplots. In terms of the ``story'' of the vignette, the authors suggest that the Dayaknese are typically viewed as the ones who were victimized, the Javanese were not involved, and the Madurese have been viewed as aggressors.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##           [,1] [,2]
## Dayaknese    1   -1
## Javanese    -2    0
## Madurese     1    1
\end{verbatim}

Viewing the contrasts() output, we see that the trends (linear, quadratic) in our contrast coding will be fit across Dayaknese, Javanese, and Madurese.

In a polynomial analysis, the statistical analysis looks across the ordered means to see if they fit a linear or curvilinear shape that is one fewer than the number of levels (i.e., \(k-1\)). Because the Rater factor has three levels, the polynomial contrast checks for linear (.L) and quadratic (one change in direction) trends (.Q). If we had four levels, \emph{contr.poly()} could also check for cubic change (two changes in direction). Conventionally, when more than one trend is significant, we interpret the most complex one (i.e., quadratic over linear).

To the best of my knowledge, \emph{rstatix} does not offer these contrasts. We can fairly easily make these calculations in base R by creating a set of polynomial contrasts. In the prior example we specified our contrasts through coding. Here we can the \emph{contr.poly(3)} function. The ``3'' lets R know that there are three levels in Rater The \emph{aov()} function will automatically test for quadratic (one hump) and linear (straight line) trends.

\textbf{Rater.L} tests the data to see if there is a significant linear trend. There is: \(t(108) = 3.556, < 0 .001\).

\textbf{Rater.Q} tests to see if there is a significant quadratic (curvilinear, one hump) trend. There is not: \(t(108) = -0.567, p = .572\).

\section{APA Style Results}\label{apa-style-results-4}}

First, I am loathe to term anything ``final.'' In academia, there is \emph{always} the possibility or revision. Given that I demonstrated a number of options in the workflow (with more in the \protect\hyperlink{moRe}{appendix}), let me first show the workflow with the particular path I took:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_mypath.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow illustrating the path taken for this analysis.}
\end{figure}

That is, I first tested the statistical assumptions and computed the omnibus ANOVA. Because there was a significant interaction effect, I followed with examination of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within ethnicity of the rater. It made sense to me to conduct the all post hoc pairwise comparisons within this simple main effect. In light of that, here's how I might write it up:

\begin{quote}
A 3 X 2 ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the effects of rater ethnicity (3 levels, Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese) and photo stimulus (2 levels, Dayaknese on Madurese,) on negative reactions to the photo stimuli. Factorial ANOVA assumes that the dependent variable is normally is distributed for all cells in the design. Skew and kurtosis values for each factorial combinations fell below the guidelines recommended by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}. That is, they were below the absolute values of 3 for skew and 10 for kurtosis. Similarly, no extreme outliers were identified and results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that model residuals did not differ significantly from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.9846, p = 0.234\)). Results of Levene's test for equality of error variances indicated a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption, (\(F[5, 105] = 8.834, p < 0.001\)). Given that cell sample sizes were roughly equal and greater than 15, each; \citep{green_using_2017} we proceded with the two-way ANOVA.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Computing sums of squares with a Type II approach, the results for the ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for ethnicity of the rater (\(F[2, 105] = 8.098, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.134\)), a significant main effect for photo stimulus, (\(F[1, 105] = 19.346, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.156\)), and a significant interaction effect (\(F[2, 105] = 5.696, p = .004, \eta ^{2} = 0.098\)).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within the ethnicity of the rater. That is, with separate one-way ANOVAs (chosen, in part, to mitigate violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \citep{kassambara_anova_nodate}) we examined the effect of the photo stimulus within the Dayaknese, Madurese, and Javanese groups. To control for Type I error across the three simple main effects, we set alpha at .017 (.05/3). Results indicated significant differences for Dayaknese (\(F [1, 33] = 50.404, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.604\)) and Javanese ethnic groups \((F [1, 35] = 17.183, p < 0.001, \eta ^{2} = 0.329)\), but not for the Madurese ethnic group \((F [1, 37] < 0.001, p = .993, \eta ^{2} < .001)\). As illustrated in Figure 1, the Dayaknese and Javanese raters both reported stronger negative reactions to the Madurese. The differences in ratings for the Madurese were not statistically significantly different. In this way, the rater's ethnic group moderated the relationship between the photo stimulus and negative reactions.

As is common in simulations, our results approximate the findings reported in the manuscript, but does not replicate them exactly. Our main and interaction effects map on very closely. However, in the follow-up tests, while our findings that Dayaknese rated the Madurese photos more negatively, the findings related to the Javanese' and Madurese' ratings wiggled around some. Given the varying variability around each of the group means (i.e., and violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption) this makes sense to me. I find it to be a useful lesson in ``what it takes'' to get stable, meaningful results.

\hypertarget{options-for-violation-of-statistical-assumptions}{%
\section{Options for Violation of Statistical Assumptions}\label{options-for-violation-of-statistical-assumptions}}

Statistical assumptions are conditions that we should meet in order for the results of a particular statistical test to be valid. They are frequently focused on the trustworthiness of the \emph{p} value. Some assumptions (e.g., dependency, random sampling) are specific to the research design. Others (e.g., normal distribution, homogeneity of variance) are ones that we evaluate with statistical tests. Thus, we are often asking, ``What do we do it we violate one of these statistical assumptions?''

\hypertarget{violating-the-assumption-of-normality}{%
\subsection{Violating the Assumption of Normality}\label{violating-the-assumption-of-normality}}

Regarding the assumption of normal distribution within each of the cells (i.e., the combinations of the levels of the two factors in the design), Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} provide some assurance that ANOVA is robust to violation of the normality assumption when there are at least 15 cases per cell and that the design is balanced (i.e., the number of cases per cell are roughly equal).

In the case of low power caused by low sample size or severely unbalanced designs, the research team may wish to consider extending the study to collect more data. Alternatively, although it is always difficult to remove cases, the researchers may inspect the data for outliers and see what happens if extreme outliers are removed or if the data is truncated at the extreme ends. Further, Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} has helpful coverage for options regarding transforming data. A substantial concern about transformations relates to the interpretability of the results.

\hypertarget{violating-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption}{%
\subsection{Violating the Homogeneity of Variance Assumption}\label{violating-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption}}

Addressing violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption feel more tricky. In one-way ANOVA, the Welch's alternative was an easily accessible alternative that is robust to the homogeneity of variance assumption.The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WRS2/index.html}{WRS2 package} has been identified as a resource for ANOVA designs with statistical methods based on Wilcox' WRS functions that are robust to these statistical violations.

One potential alternative is to change the sums of squares type used in the ANOVA calculations. In ANOVA models sums of squares can be calculated four different ways: Types I, II, III, and IV.

SS Type II is the \emph{aov()} default. Because \emph{rstatix()} is a wrapper for \emph{aov()} it is similarly the default for \emph{rstatix()}. I find it to be a best practice to include the \emph{type = } argument in my code so that I am reminded of the need to make this choice.

\textbf{Type I} sums of squares is similar to hierarchical linear regression in that the first predictor in the model claims as much variance as it can and the leftovers are claimed by the variable entered next -- each claiming as much as possible leaving the leftovers for what follows. Unless the variables are completely independent of each other (unlikely), Type I sums of squares cannot evaluate the true main effect of each variable. Type I should not be used to evaluate main effects and interactions because the order of predictors will affect the results.

\textbf{Type II} (the default in the package we used) is appropriate if you are interested main effects because it ignores the effect of any interactions involving the main effect. Thus, variance from a main effect is not ``lost'' to any interaction terms containing that effect. Type II is appropriate for main effects analyses only, but should not be used when evaluating interaction effects. Type II sums of squares is not affected by the type of contrast coding used to specify the predictor variables.

\textbf{Type III} is the default in many stats packages -- but not the R packages we used. In Type III all effects (main effects and interactions) are evaluated (simultaneously) taking into consideration all other effects in the model (not just the ones entered before). Type III is more robust to unequal samples sizes (e.g., unbalanced designs). Type III is best when predictors are encoded with orthogonal contrasts.

\emph{\textbf{Type IV} is identical to Type III except it requires no missing cells. In }rstatix::anova\_test*, this type is not available.

Researchers appear to disagree about which sums of squares type to use. Certainly, when package and program developers specify a default. The \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} that we used (which is a wrapper for the \emph{aov()} in base R) has set Type II as the default. In contrast, Field \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} suggested that it is safest to stick with Type III sums of squares. For more information, check out this explanation on \href{https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/03/anova-\%E2\%80\%93-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/}{r-bloggers}.

In this lesson I stuck with the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} default because

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type II sums of squares was used in hand-calculations,
\item
  Our example was reasonably balanced (equal cell sizes), and
\item
  We had only violated the homogeneity of variance assumption.
\end{itemize}

For demonstration purposes, let's run the Type III alternative to see the differences:

Note that the sums of squares are somewhat different between models -- and that the Type III results includes an intercept. In today's example, the statistical significance remains the same across the models.

Unfortunately, violations of the assumption of homogeneity variance impact choices at both the omnibus and follow-up levels of analysis \citep{green_using_2017}. Kassambara \citeyearpar{kassambara_anova_nodate} noted that when the homogeneity of variance assumption has been violated, it is better to follow-up a significant omnibus with separate one-way ANOVAs because these offer separate and unique error terms. One operational advantage to this is option is that researchers can return to procedures for one-way ANOVA, assessing for violations at that level and using the Welch's alternative for the follow-up of simple main effects or main effects.

\hypertarget{power-analysis-1}{%
\section{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-1}}

Asking about \emph{power} can be a euphemistic way of asking, ``How large should my sample size be?''

Power is defined as the ability of the test to detect statistical significance when there is such. It's represented formulaically as (1 - \emph{P})(Type II error). Power is traditionally set at 80\% (or .8)

We will do both -- evaluate the power of our current example and then work backwards to estimate the sample size needed.

We'll use the \emph{pwr.2way()} function from the \emph{pwr2} package. Helpful resources are found here:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr2/pwr2.pdf}
\item
  \url{https://rdrr.io/cran/pwr2/man/ss.2way.html}
\end{itemize}

The \emph{pwr.2way()} and \emph{ss.2way()} functions require the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{a} number of groups in Factor A
\item
  \textbf{b} number of groups in Factor B
\item
  \textbf{alpha} significant level (Type I error probability)
\item
  \textbf{beta} Type II error probability (Power = 1 - beta; traditionally set at .1 or .2)
\item
  \textbf{f.A} the \emph{f} effect size of Factor A
\item
  \textbf{f.B} the \emph{f} effect size of Factor B
\item
  \textbf{B} Iteration times, default is 100
\end{itemize}

Hints for calculating the \emph{f.A} and \emph{f.B} values:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this case, we will rerun the statistic, grab both effect sizes, and convert them to the \emph{f} (not the \(f^2\))

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    calculation can be straightforward, either use an online calculator, a hand-calculated formula, or the \emph{eta2\_to\_f} function from the \emph{effectsize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When an effect size is unknown, you can substitute what you expect using Cohen's guidelines of .10, .25, and .40 as small, medium, and large (for the \emph{f}, not \(F^2\))
\end{itemize}

Let's quickly rerun our model to get both the df and calculate the \emph{f} effect value

If we want to understand power in our analysis, we need to convert our effect size (\(\eta^2\)) for the \emph{interaction} to \(f\) effect size (this is not the same as the \emph{F} test). The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function.

Often times researchers will play around with the \emph{f} values. Remember Cohen's indication of small (.10), medium (.25), and large (.40). Let's see what happens when we enter different values. Specifically, what if we only had a medium effect?

\hypertarget{practice-problems-6}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-6}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. At a minimum your data should allow for a 2 X 3 (or 3 X 2) design. At least one of the problems you work should have a statistically significant interaction effect that you work all the way through.

Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in factorial-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

Additionally, please complete at least one set of \emph{hand calculations}, that is use the code demonstrated in the chapter to work through the formulas that compute the factorial ANOVA. At this stage in your learning, you may ignore any missingness in your dataset by excluding all rows with missing data in your variables of interest.

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-1}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-1}}

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If two-way ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210731)'' from 210731 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}

The Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} article has two dependent variables (negative and positive evaluation). Each is suitable for two-way ANOVA. I used \emph{negative evaluation} as the dependent variable; you are welcome to conduct the analysis with \emph{positive evaluation} as the dependent variable.

\hypertarget{problem-3-try-something-entirely-new.-1}{%
\subsection{Problem \#3: Try something entirely new.}\label{problem-3-try-something-entirely-new.-1}}

Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g., IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from an open science repository; data from other chapters in this OER), complete a two-way, factorial ANOVA. Please have at least 3 levels for one predictor and at least 2 levels for the second predictor.

I want to ask the question, do course evaluation ratings for the traditional pedagogy dimension differ for students in the ANOVA class as a function of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Stage} in the transition

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    STABLE: 2017 represents the last year of ``stability during the old way'' when we taught with SPSS and during the 2nd year of the doctoral programs.
  \item
    TRANSITION: 2018 \& 2019 represent the transition to R, when the classes were 30\% larger because each of the IOP and CPY departments were transitioning to the 1st year (they did it separately, so as not to double the classes)
  \item
    RESETTLED: 2020 \& 2021 represent the ``resettled'' phase where the transition to R was fairly complete and the class size returned to normal because the classes were offered in the first year.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Department}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    CPY: Clinical Psychology
  \item
    ORG: Industrial-Organizational Psychology
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could create a different subset of data. I worked the example for students taking the ANOVA class. You could choose multivariate or psychometrics. You could also choose a different dependent variable. I chose the traditional pedagogy subscale. Two other subscales include socially responsive pedagogy and valued by the student.}

Let's first create the ``Stage'' variable that represents the three levels of transition. The ProgramYear variable contains the information I need, but the factor labels are not intuitive. Let me remap them.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Each student in the dataset could contribute up to three course evaluations (i.e., one each for ANOVA, multivariate, psychometrics). Including all three would introduce \emph{dependency} into the dataset and violate the assumption of independence. With our variables properly formatted let's create a subset with just the students who took ANOVA.

\begin{Shaded}

Next, let's trim it to just the variables we need.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Although we would handle missing data more carefully in a ``real study,'' I will delete all cases with any missingness. This will prevent problems in the hand-calculations section, later (and keep the two sets of results more similar).

Before we continue, this data has a hiccup that makes it less than ideal for a 2 x 3 ANOVA. In 2017 everyone enrolled in the CPY section of the course. That is, there was no distinction between CPY and ORG students. In this dataset I do not have another variable with three levels. I will recode some data which MAKES THE STORY UNTRUE, but will allow me to demo 2-way ANOVA (sighhhh). For your homework, you are very welcome to engage in such practices (it's actually good for learning!) however, we would never do so in the analysis of real data.

The Shapiro-Wilk examines residuals from the ANOVA model. We can quickly/preliminarily run the two-way ANOVA. We do this to produce an object that holds the \emph{model residuals.}

A statistically significant Shapiro-Wilks' test of normality suggests that we violated the assumption \(W = 0.949, p < 0.001\).

The dots stray from the expected diagonal; this also visualizes the non-normality of the data.

Summary so far:

\begin{quote}
Factorial ANOVA assumes that the dependent variable is normally is distributed for all cells in the design. Although our analysis suggested skew and kurtosis were within the bounds considered to be normally distributed, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that the plotting of the residuals differed significantly from a normal distribution \(W = 0.949, p < 0.001\).
\end{quote}

\textbf{Are there outliers?}

Given the non-normality of the data, we can use the following procedure to see if there are outliers that could be transformed, truncated, or removed.

## 3 Transition  ORG     1.4       TRUE      FALSE
## 4 Transition  ORG     1.6       TRUE      FALSE
\end{verbatim}

There are four outliers; none are extreme. Given that these are all on the low-side (of a negatively skewed distribution where most scores are higher), I feel it is important to retain them as they reflect more students' experiences. If this were for something other than a homework demonstration, I might also take a look at the case to see if there was evidence of inattention or something else.

\textbf{Are the variances of the dependent variable similar across the all combinations of the levels within the grouping variables?}

We can evaluate the homogeneity of variance test with Levene's test for the equality of error variances.

## 1     5   106      6.41 0.0000305
\end{verbatim}

Levene's test has indicated a violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption \((F[5, 106] = 6.412, p < .001)\). This is not surprising. The boxplots shows some widely varying variances.

Do we have to stop? If cell sizes are reasonably large (e.g., at least 15) and balanced (equal), ANOVA is a relatively robust to violations of normality. Unfortunately, we don't have 15 in all cells AND our cells are unequal AND this was not an experiment. So\ldots..this probably isn't the best approach (but it'll work for a class demo).

Let's write the F strings from the above table:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Department main effect: \(F(1, 106) = 11.395, p = 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.097\)
\item
  Stage main effect: \(F(2, 106) = 10.070 , p < 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.160\)
\item
  Interaction effect: \(F(2, 106) = 4.904, p = 0.009, \eta^2 = 0.085\)
\end{itemize}

So far we have statistically significant effects for the main and interaction effects. Here are the results so far:

\begin{quote}
Computing sums of squares with a Type II approach, the results for the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant effects for the main effect of department, \(F(1, 106) = 11.395, p = 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.097\); the main effect for stage in transition, \(F(2, 106) = 10.070, p < 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.160\); and the interaction effect, \(F(2, 106) = 4.904, p = 0.009, \eta^2 = 0.085\).

\subsubsection{Conduct one set of follow-up tests; narrate your choice.}\label{conduct-one-set-of-follow-up-tests-narrate-your-choice.-1}}

There are so many choices for following up a significant interaction effect. Regardless, we always follow a statistically significant interaction effect with an analysis of simple main effects. I think I am interested in the simple main effects for stage within department. This means I will conduct one-way ANOVAS for CPY and ORG, separately. And, if either is significant, I will look for differences across the stages.

Although we could do something more complicated (like orthogonal contrast coding), given that those completing homework are often having early experiences with ANOVA, I will choose a more streamlined path by examining the the simple main effect of stage within department.

Functionally, this computes two one-way ANOVAs, comparing the three stages within each of the departments. If the result is statistically significant, we will need to follow-up with more testing.

The \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} does not allow me to specify a control for Type I error. Therefore, if I wanted to do so, I would need to monitor it outside of the R package. I \emph{could} evaluate each of the \emph{p} values for the two one-way ANOVAs at 0.025 (05/2). Rather than tracking Type I error at this level, I will wait and do so when I get to the pairwise comparisons that follow a statistically significant one-way ANOVA.

Results suggest statistically significant differences in department across the stages within the CPY department, but not the ORG department:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For CPY: \(F(2, 58) = 18.497, p < 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.389\)
\item
  For ORG: \(F(2, 48) = 1.417, p = 0.252, \eta^2 = 0.056\)
\end{itemize}

I would write up this stage of the analysis this way:

\begin{quote}
To explore the significant interaction effect, we followed with a test of simple main effect of the stage in transition within the academic department. We began with separate one-way ANOVAs. Results indicated significant differences within the CPY deparmtent \((F[2, 58] = 18.497, p < 0.001, \eta^2 = 0.389)\), but not for the ORG department \((F[2, 48] = 1.417, p = 0.252, \eta^2 = 0.056)\).
\end{quote}

Because there are three stages of transition, we need to followup with pairwise comparisons to see where the differences lie. Because I want to results from the significance tests to update the figure, I will save the output as an object.

Although, technically, we only needed to compare 3 pairwise tests, this test (and figure) will compute them all. The Holm's Sequential Bonferroni is a very reasonable approach (balancing Type I error with sensibility) and so I will use it to evaluate the six pairwise comparisons that will be produced.

Consistent with the significant one-way ANOVA for the ORG factor, there were non-significant differences between all pairs of stages. Within the CPY student evaluations, there were statistically significant differences between stable and transition and stabled and resettled comparisons. Both comparisons favored the stable level.

Here'w how I would assemble the entire APA style results:

I managed Type I error with the Holm's sequential Bonferroni. The Holm's is less conservative than the traditional Bonferroni because it adjusts the thresshold for statistical significance in a stepwise manner that takes into consideration the rank order of the \emph{p} values and the number of comparisons made.

At 100\% (Dept), 100 (Stage), and 100\% (interaction), our power to detect statistically significant main and interaction effects was strong

\subsection{Hand Calculations}\label{hand-calculations-5}}

Before we continue:

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. This is because the formula we have used for the hand-calculations utilizes an approach to calculating the sums of squares that presumes that we have a balanced design (i.e., that the cell sizes are equal). When cell sizes are unequal (i.e., an unbalanced design) the Type II package in \emph{rstatix::anova\_test} will produce different result.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in ANOVA models. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of ANOVA, we would take more time to understand what is occurring. My goal is to provide you with enough of an introduction to ANOVA that you would be able to explore further which sums of squares type would be most appropriate for your unique ANOVA model.

Here is the formula I will use for calculating the sums of squares total: \[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]

I will use \emph{psych::describe()} to obtain the overall mean:

The overall (grand) mean is 4.06.

I will create a variable that represents the mean deviation:

You may notice that these calculations don't exactly follow the rules of the lecture. For example, The ``model and''residual'' should equal the total. I believe this is because there are different cell sizes which causes an unbalanced design and throws off the otherwise perfect calculations. This issue of unbalanced design is an important one in ANOVA.

Checking to see if my sums of squares a, b, and axb equal the SSM; and that SSM + SSR = SST.

In the prior lessons, a critical assumption is that the observations must be ``independent.'' That is, related people (partners, parent/child, manager/employee) cannot comprise the data and there cannot be multiple waves of data for the same person. Repeated measures ANOVA is created specifically for this \emph{dependent} purpose. This lessons focuses on the one-way repeated measures ANOVA, where we measure changes across time.

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate the suitability of a research design/question and dataset for conducting a one-way repeated measures ANOVA; identify alternatives if the data is not suitable.
\item
  Hand-calculate a one-way repeated measures ANOVAs

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    describing the partitioning of variance as it relates to model/residual; within/between.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Test the assumptions for one-way repeated measures ANOVA.
\item
  Conduct a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (omnibus and follow-up) in R.
\item
  Interpret output from the one-way repeated measures ANOVA (and follow-up).
\item
  Prepare an APA style results section of the one-way repeated measures ANOVA output.
\item
  Demonstrate how an increased sample size increases the power of a statistical test.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-6}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-6}}

The suggestions for homework vary in degree of challenge with more complete descriptions at the end of the chapter follow these suggestions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  There were no additional variables in this example. However, you'll see we do have an issue with statistical power. Perhaps change the sample size to see if it changes (maybe stabilizes?) the results.
\item
  Conduct a one-way repeated measures ANOVA with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introducing-one-way-repeated-measures-anova}{%
\section{Introducing One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA}\label{introducing-one-way-repeated-measures-anova}}

There are a couple of typical use cases for one-way repeated measures ANOVA. In the first, the research participant is assessed in multiple conditions -- with no interested in change-over-time.

An example of a research design using this approach occurred in the Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_one-way_2017-1} statistics text, the one-way repeated measures vignette compared teachers' perception of stress when responding to parents, teachers, and school administrators.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway_repeated/repeated_conditions.jpg}
\caption{Illustration of a research design appropriate for one-way repeated measures ANOVA}
\end{figure}

Another common use case is about time. The classic design is a pre-test, an intervention, a post-test, and a follow up. In designs like these researchers often hope that there is a positive change from pre-to-post and that that change either stays constant (from post-to-follow-up) or, perhaps, increases even further. The research vignette for this lesson is interested in change-over-time.

  Preparing and importing the data.

  Exploring the data

  \begin{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Checking distributional assumptions

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    assessing normality via skew, kurtosis, Shapiro Wilks
  \item
    checking or violation of the \emph{sphericity} assumption with Mauchly's test; if violated interpret the corrected output or use a multivariate approach for the analysis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Computing the omnibus ANOVA
\item
  Computing post hoc comparisons, planned contrasts, or polynomial trends
\item
  Managing Type I error
\item
  Sample size/power analysis (which you should think about first -- but in the context of teaching ANOVA, it's more pedagogically sensible, here)

\hypertarget{research-vignette-6}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-6}}

Amodeo \citep{amodeo_empowering_2018} and colleagues conducted a mixed methods study (qualitative and quantitative) to evaluate the effectiveness of an empowerment, peer-group-based, intervention with participants (\emph{N} = 8) who experienced transphobic episodes. Focus groups used qualitative methods to summarize emergent themes from the program (identity affirmation, self-acceptance, group as support) and a one-way, repeated measures ANOVA provided evidence of increased resilience from pre to three-month followup.

Eight participants (seven transgender women and one genderqueer person) participated in the intervention. The mean age was 28.5 (\emph{SD} = 5.85). All participants were located in Italy.

The within-subjects condition was wave, represented by T1, T2, and T3:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  T1, beginning of training
\item
  Training, three 8-hour days,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    content included identity and heterosexism, sociopolitical issues and minority stress, resilience, and empowerment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  T2, at the conclusion of the 3-day training
\item
  Follow-up session 3 months later
\item
  T3, at the conclusion of the +3 month follow-up session
\end{itemize}

The dependent variable (assessed at each wave) was a 14-item resilience scale \citep{wagnild_development_1993}. Items were assessed on a 7-point scale ranging from \emph{strongly disagree} to \emph{strongly agree} with higher scores indicating higher levels of resilience. An example items was, ``I usually manage one way or another.''

Let's take a look at the structure of our variables. We want ID to be a factor, Resilience to be numeric, and Wave to be an ordered factor (Pre, Post, FollowUp).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

 $ Resilience: num  6.49 5.28 5.93 4.43 5.95 ...
\end{verbatim}

We need to update Wave to be an ordered factor. Because R's default is to order factors alphabetically, we can use the levels command and identify our preferred order.

\hypertarget{shape-shifters}{%
\paragraph{Shape Shifters}\label{shape-shifters}}

The form of our data matters. The simulation created a \emph{long} form (formally called the \emph{person-period} form) of data. That is, each observation for each person is listed in its own row. In this dataset where we have 8 people with 3 observation (pre, post, follow-up) each, we have 24 rows. This is convenient, because this is the form we need for repeated measures ANOVA.

However, for some of the calculations (particularly those we will do by hand), we need the data to be in its more familiar wide form (formally called the \emph{person level} form). We can do this with the \emph{data.table} and \emph{reshape2}()* packages.

\end{Shaded}

In this reshape script, I asked for a quick structure check. The format of the variables looks correct.

If you want to export these data as files to your computer, remove the hashtags to save (and re-import) them as .rds (R object) or .csv (``Excel lite'') files. This is not a necessary step to continue working the problem in this lesson.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. I would choose this option.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# to save the df as an .rds (think \textquotesingle{}R object\textquotesingle{}) file on your computer;}
\CommentTok{\# it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working}
\CommentTok{\# with saveRDS(Amodeo\_long, \textquotesingle{}Amodeo\_longRDS.rds\textquotesingle{})}
\CommentTok{\# saveRDS(Amodeo\_wide, \textquotesingle{}Amodeo\_wideRDS.rds\textquotesingle{}) bring back the simulated}
\CommentTok{\# dat from an .rds file Amodeo\_long \textless{}{-} readRDS(\textquotesingle{}Amodeo\_longRDS.rds\textquotesingle{})}
\CommentTok{\# Amodeo\_wide \textless{}{-} readRDS(\textquotesingle{}Amodeo\_wideRDS.rds\textquotesingle{})}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Another option is to write them as .csv files. The code for .csv will likely lose any variable formatting, but the .csv file is easy to view and manipulate in Excel. If you choose this option, you will probably need to re-run the prior code to reformat Wave as an ordered factor

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(Amodeo\_long,}

\section{Working the One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA (by hand)}\label{working-the-one-way-repeated-measures-anova-by-hand}}

Before working our problem in R, let's gain a conceptual understanding by partitioning the variance by hand.

In repeated measures ANOVA: \(SS_T = SS_B + SS_W\), where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  B = between-subjects variance
\item
  W = within-subjects variance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(SS_W = SS_M + SS_R\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

What differs is that \(SS_M\) and \(SS_R\) (model and residual) are located in \(SS_W\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(SS_T = SS_B + (SS_M + SS_R)\)
\end{itemize}

Our formulas for \(SS_{T}\) are the same as they were for one-way and factorial ANOVA:

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\] \[SS_{T}= s_{grand}^{2}(n-1)\] Degrees of freedom for \(SS_T\) is \emph{N} - 1, where \emph{N} is the total number of cells.

Let's take a moment to \emph{hand-calculate} \(SS_{T}\) (but using R).

In this case, we are interested in change in resilience over time. Hence, \emph{time} is our factor. In our equation, we have three chunks representing the pre, post, and follow-up \emph{conditions} (waves). From each, we subtract the grand mean, square it, and multiply by the \emph{n} observed in each wave.

The degrees of freedom (df) for \(SS_M\) is \emph{k} - 1

Our example has 2 (numerator) and 14 (denominator) degrees of freedom. If we use a table we find the corresponding degrees of freedom combinations for the column where \(\alpha = .05\). We observe that any \(F\) value \textgreater{} 3.73 will be statistically significant. Our \(F\) = 3.87, so we have (just barely) exceeded the threshold. This is our \emph{omnibus F}. We know there is at least 1 statistically significant difference between our pre, post, and follow-up conditions.

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. Hand calculations and those used in the R packages likely differ on how the sums of squares is calculated. While the results are ``close-ish'' they are not always identical.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in ANOVA models. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of ANOVA, we would take more time to understand what is occurring. My goal is to provide you with enough of an introduction to ANOVA that you would be able to explore further which sums of squares type would be most appropriate for your unique ANOVA model.

\subsection{Testing the assumptions}\label{testing-the-assumptions}}

We will start by testing the assumptions. Highlighting in the figure notes our place in the one-way ANOVA workflow:

\end{figure}

There are several different ways to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA. Each has different assumptions/requirements. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  univariate statistics

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is what we will use today.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  multivariate statistics

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Functionally similar to univariate, except the underlying algorithm does not require the sphericity assumption.
  \item
    An example of using a multivariate approach to working the problem (using the \emph{car} package) is in the \protect\hyperlink{RMmultiv}{appendix}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  multi-level modeling/hierarchical linear modeling

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This a different statistic altogether and is addressed in the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/MultilevelModeling}{multilevel modeling OER}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{univariate-assumptions-for-repeated-measures-anova}{%
\subsubsection{Univariate assumptions for repeated measures ANOVA}\label{univariate-assumptions-for-repeated-measures-anova}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The cases represent a random sample from the population.
\item
  There is no dependency in the scores \emph{between} participants.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Of course there is intentional dependency in the repeated measures (or within-subjects) factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are no significant outliers in any cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check by visualizing the data using box plots. The \emph{identify\_outliers()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package identifies extreme outliers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for each level of the within-subjects factor.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality for each of the levels of the DV.
  \item
    Visually examine Q-Q plots.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The population variance of difference scores computed between any two levels of a within-subjects factor is the same value regardless of which two levels are chosen; termed the \textbf{sphericity assumption}. This assumption is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    akin to compound symmetry (both variances across conditions are equal).
  \item
    akin to the homogeneity of variance assumption in between-group designs.
  \item
    sometimes called the homogeneity-of-variance-of-differences assumption.
  \item
    statistically evaluated with \emph{Mauchly's test.} If Mauchly's \emph{p} \textless{} .05, there are statistically significant differences. The \emph{anova\_test()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package reports Mauchly's and two alternatives to the traditional \emph{F} that correct the values by the degree to which the sphericity assumption is violated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{demonstrating-sphericity}{%
\subsubsection{Demonstrating sphericity}\label{demonstrating-sphericity}}

Using the data from our motivating example, I calculated differences for each of the time variables. These are the three columns (in green shading) on the right. The variance for each is reported at the bottom of the column.

When we get into the analysis, we will use \emph{Mauchly's test} in hopes that there are non-significant differences in variances between all three of the comparisons.

We are only concerned with the sphericity assumption if there are three or more groups.

\[variance_{A-B} \approx variance_{A-C}\approx variance_{B-C}\]

Our skew and kurtosis values fall below the thresholds of concern \citep{kline_data_2016}:

The \emph{Shapiro-Wilk} test evaluates the hypothesis that the distribution of the data deviates from a comparable normal distribution. If the test is non-significant (\emph{p} \textgreater.05) the distribution of the sample is not significantly different from a normal distribution. If, however, the test is significant (\emph{p} \textless{} .05), then the sample distribution is significantly different from a normal distribution. The \emph{rstatix} package can conduct this test for us.

3 FollowUp Resilience     0.926 0.480
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{p} value is \textgreater{} .05 for each of the cells. This provides some assurance that we have not violated the assumption of normality at any level of the design.

The \(p\) values for the distributions of the dependent variable (Resilience) in each wave of the study are all well above .05. This tells us that the Resilience variable does not deviate from a statistically significant distribution at any level (Pre, \(W = 0.929, p = 0.418\); Post, \(p = 0.941, p = 0.617\); FellowUp, \(W = 0.926, p = 0.430\)).

Especially in the more simple ``ANOVA's'' I like this form of the Shapiro-Wilk test because it makes it clear that we expect normality within each of the grouping levels. This approach, however, is only appropriate when there are a low number of levels/groupings and there are many data points per group. As models become more complex, researchers should use the model-based option for assessing normality. To do this, we first create an object that tests our research model.

Although that model (a regression model) has information about the results of our primary analysis, at this point we are only using it to investigate the assumption of normality. One product of the analysis is \emph{residuals}. Residuals are the unexplained variance in the outcome (or dependent) variable after accounting for the predictor (or independent) variable. When we plot these ``leftovers'' against the values of x, we can visualize the fit of the model in a QQ plot. The dots represent the residuals. When they are relatively close to the line they not only suggest good fit of the model, but we know they are small and evenly distributed around zero (i.e., normally distributed).

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{09-OneWayRepeated_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-33-1.pdf}

We can also use the model in a Shapiro-Wilk test. As before, we want a non-significant result.

1 residuals(RMres_model)     0.957   0.385
\end{verbatim}

These results are consistent with what we have already learned. That is, the non-significant \emph{p} value associated with the model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicates that our distribution of residuals does not differ from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.957, p = 0.385\)). Given the space restrictions in journal articles and the higher priority of describing the results of the primary analyses, I am more likely to report model-level results than the results from the cell-based Shapiro-Wilk tests.

There are limitations to the Shapiro-Wilk test. As the dataset being evaluated gets larger, the Shapiro-Wilk test becomes more sensitive to small deviations; this leads to a greater probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (null hypothesis being the values come from a normal distribution). Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} advised that ANOVA is relatively robust to violations of normality if there are at least 15 cases per cell and the design is reasonably balanced (i.e., equal cell sizes).

\subsubsection{Are there any outliers (and should we consider their removal)?}\label{are-there-any-outliers-and-should-we-consider-their-removal}}

The boxplot is one common way for identifying outliers. The boxplot uses the median and the lower (25th percentile) and upper (75th percentile) quartiles. The difference bewteen Q3 and Q1 is the \emph{interquartile range} (IQR). Outliers are generally identified when values fall outside these lower and upper boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 1.5xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 1.5xIQR
\end{itemize}

Extreme values occur when values fall outside these boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 3xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 3xIQR
\end{itemize}

Let's take another look at the boxplot. Swapping ``jitter'' for ``point'' may help with the visual inspection.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{09-OneWayRepeated_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-35-1.pdf}

The package \emph{rstatix} has features that allow us to identify outliers.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#?identify\_outliers}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The output, ``0 rows'' indicates there are no outliers.

This is consistent with the visual inspection of boxplots (above), where all observed scores fell within the 1.5x the interquartile range. If there were outliers and you chose to delete them, instructions for doing so are found in the parallel sections of the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA} and \protect\hyperlink{between}{factorial ANOVA} lessons.

\hypertarget{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions-2}{%
\subsubsection{Summarizing results from the analysis of assumptions}\label{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions-2}}

Here's how I would write up the assumptions we have tested thus far:

Similarly, no extreme outliers were identified and results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, indicated that the model residuals did not did differ from a normal distribution \((W = 0.979, p = 0.15)\).

\begin{quote}
Repeated measures ANOVA has several assumptions regarding normality, outliers, and sphericity. Regarding normality, no values of skew and kurtosis (at each wave of assessment) fell within cautionary ranges for skew and kurtosis \citep{kline_data_2016}. Additionally, results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the model residuals did not differ from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.957, p = 0.385\)). Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{identify\_outliers()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated no outliers.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{assumption-of-sphericity}{%
\subsubsection{Assumption of Sphericity}\label{assumption-of-sphericity}}

The sphericity assumption is automatically checked with Mauchley's test during the computation of the ANOVA when the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} function is used. When the \emph{rstatix::get\_anova\_table()} function is used, the Greenhouse-Geisser sphericity correction is automatically applied to factors violating the sphericity assumption.

The effect size, \(\eta^2\) is reported in the column labeled ``ges.'' Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

You may see different values (.02, .13, .26) offered as small, medium, and large -- these values are used when multiple regression is used. A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

Earlier in the lesson I noted that the evaluation of the sphericity assumption occurs at the same time that we evaluate the omnibus ANOVA. We are at that point in the analyses. The workflow points to our stage in the process.

\hypertarget{computing-the-test-statistic}{%
\subsection{Computing the Test Statistic}\label{computing-the-test-statistic}}

As we prepare to run the omnibus ANOVA it may be helpful to think again about our variables. Our DV, Resilience, should be a continuous variable. In R, its structure should be ``num.'' Our predictor, Wave, should be categorical. In R case, Wave should be an ordered factor that is consistent with its timing: pre, post, follow-up.

The repeated measures ANOVA must be run with a long form of the data. This means that there needs to be a within-subjects identifier. In our case, it is the ``ID'' variable which is also formatted as a factor.

We can verify the format of our variables by examining the structure of our dataframe. Recall that we created the ``m\_dev'' and ``m\_devSQ'' variables earlier in the demonstration. We will not use them in this analysis; it does not harm anything for them to ``ride along'' in the dataframe.

We can assemble our \emph{F} string from the ANOVA object: \(F(2,14) = 3.91, p = 0.045, \eta^2 = 0.203\)

From the Mauchly's Test for Sphericity object we learn that we did not violate the sphericity assumption: \(W = 0.566, p = .182\)

From the Sphericity Corrections object are output for two alternative corrections to the \emph{F} statistic, the Greenhouse-Geiser epsilon (GGe), and Huynh-Feldt epsilon (HFe). Because we did not violate the sphericity assumption we do not need to use them. Notice that these two tests adjust our df (both numerator and denominator) to have a more conservative p value.

If we needed to write an \emph{F} string that is corrected for violation of the sphericity assumption, it might look like this:

\begin{quote}
The Greenhouse Geiser estimate was 0.698 the correct omnibus was \emph{F}(1.4, 9.77) = 3.91, \emph{p} = .068. The Huyhn Feldt estimate was 0.817 and the corrected omnibus was \emph{F} (1.63, 11.44) = 3.91 \emph{p} = .057.
\end{quote}

You might be surprised that we are at follow-up already.

\includegraphics{images/oneway_repeated/wf_rptd_pairwise.jpg} \#\#\# Planning for the management of Type I Error

In a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, managing Type I error can be relatively straightforward.

The LSD (least significant differences) method is especially appropriate in the one-way ANOVA scenario when there are only three levels in the factor. In this case, Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} have suggested that alpha can be retained at the alpha level for the ``family'' (\(\alpha_{family}\)), which is conventionally \(p = .05\) and used both to evaluate the omnibus and, so long as they don't exceed three in number, the planned or pairwise comparisons that follow. Because there are only three levels (i.e., pre, post, follow-up) in this one-way repeated measures design this is what I will do.

More information about options for managing Type I error is included in the \protect\hyperlink{type1}{appendix}.

\hypertarget{follow-up-to-omnibus-f}{%
\subsection{Follow-up to Omnibus F}\label{follow-up-to-omnibus-f}}

Given the simplicity of our design, it makes sense to me to follow-up with post hoc, pairwise, comparisons. Note that when I am calculating these pairwise \emph{t} tests, I am creating an object (named ``pwc''). The object will be a helpful tool in creating a Figure and an APA Style table.

Note that the script used to produced the figure will pull the symbols from the column labeled, ``p.adj.signif.'' The \emph{rstatix::pairwise\_t\_test} default is the traditional Bonferroni. Therefore, if we want to use the LSD approach, we must ``p.adjust.method'' as ``none.''

Although omnibus test had a statistically significant result, we did not obtain statistically significant results in an of the posthoc pairwise comparisons. Why not?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Our omnibus \emph{F} was right at the margins

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a larger sample size (assuming that the effects would hold) would have been more powerful.
  \item
    there could be significance if we compared pre to the combined effects of post and follow-up.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

How would we manage Type I error? With only three possible post-omnibus comparisons, I would cite the Tukey LSD approach and not adjust the alpha to a more conservative level \citep{green_using_2017}.

We can combine information from the object we created (``bxp'') from an earlier boxplot with the object we saved from the posthoc pairwise comparisons (``pwc) to enhance our boxplot with the \emph{F} string and indications of pairwise significant (or, in our case, non-significance).

Regarding normality, no values of skew and kurtosis (at each wave of assessment) fell within cautionary ranges for skew and kurtosis \citep{kline_data_2016}. Additionally, results of a model-based Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicated that the model residuals did not differ from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.957, p = 0.385\)). Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{identify\_outliers()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated no outliers. A non-significant Mauchley's test (\(W = 0.566, p = .182\)) indicated that the sphericity assumption was not violated.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The omnibus ANOVA was significant: \(F(2,14) = 3.91, p = 0.045, \eta^2 = 0.203\). We followed up with all pairwise comparisons. Curiously, and in spite of a significant omnibus test, there were not statistically significant differences between any of the pairs. Regarding pre versus post, \(t = -2.15, p= .069\). Regarding pre versus follow-up, \(t = -2.00, p = .068\). Regarding post versus follow-up, \(t = 1.059, p = .325\). Because there were only three pairwise comparisons subsequent to the omnibus test, we used the LSD (least significant differences) approach to managing Type I error and alpha was retained at .05 \citep{green_using_2017}. While the trajectories from pre-to-post and pre-to-follow-up were in the expected direction, the small sample size likely contributed to a Type II error. Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1 and the differences are illustrated in Figure 1.

How do our findings and our write-up from the simulated data compare with the original article?

In the published manuscript, the \emph{F} string is presented in the Table 1 note (\(F[1.612, 11.283]) = 6.390, p = 0.18, \eta _{p}^{2}\)). We can tell from the fractional degrees of freedom that the \emph{p} value has been had a correction for violation of the sphericity assumption.

Table 1 also reports all of the post hoc, pairwise comparisons. There is no mention of control for Type I error. Had they used a traditional Bonferroni, they would have needed to reduce the alpha to (k*(k-1)/2) and then divide .05 by that number.

Although Amodeo et al.~report six comparisons; three are repeated because they are merely in reverse. Thus, the revised alpha would be .016 and the one, lone, comparison would not have been statistically significant. That said, the Tukey LSD is appropriate because there are only 3 comparisons and holding alpha at .05 can be defended \citep{green_using_2017}.

\section{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-2}}

Power analysis allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. The package \emph{wp.rmanova} was designed for power analysis in repeated measures ANOVA.

In the \emph{WebPower} package, we specify 6 of 7 interrelated elements; the package computes the missing one.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size (number of individuals in the whole study).
\item
  \emph{ng} = number of groups.
\item
  \emph{nm} = number of measurements/conditions/waves.
\item
  \emph{f} = Cohen's \emph{f} (an effect size; we can use an effect size converter to obtain this value)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{nscor} = the Greenhouse Geiser correction from our ouput; 1.0 means no correction was needed and is the package's default; \textless{} 1 means some correction was applied.
\item
  \emph{alpha} = is the probability of Type I error; we traditionally set this at .05
\item
  \emph{power} = 1 - P(Type II error) we traditionally set this at .80 (so anything less is less than what we want).
\item
  \emph{type} = 0 is for between-subjects, 1 is for repeated measures, 2 is for interaction effect.
\end{itemize}

I used \emph{effectsize::eta2\_to\_f} packages convert our \(\eta^2\) to Cohen's \emph{f}.

Here we learned that we were only powered at .16. That is, we had a 16\% chance of finding a statistically significant effect if, in fact, it existed. This is low!

In reverse, setting \emph{power} at .80 (the traditional value) and changing \emph{n} to \emph{NULL} yields a recommended sample size.\\

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-7}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. All problems attempted should have at least three levels in the independent variable. At least one problem should have a significant omnibus test and require follow-up.

Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way repeated measures/within-subjects ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a one-way, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables

I want to ask the question, do course evaluation ratings for the traditional pedagogy dimension differ for students across the ANOVA, multivariate, and psychometrics courses (in that order, because that's the order in which the students take the class.)

The dependent variable is the evaluation of traditional pedagogy. The independent variable is course/time (i.e., each student offers course evaluations in each of the three classes).

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, the three different classes are the only repeated measures variable. Rather, you could choose a different dependent variable. I chose the traditional pedagogy subscale. Two other subscales include socially responsive pedagogy and valued by the student.}

The distribution of model residuals is statistically significantly different than a normal distribution \((W = 0.876, p < .001)\). Although we have violated the assumption of normality, ANOVA models are relatively robust to such a violation when cell sizes are roughly equal and greater than 15 each \citep{green_one-way_2017-1}.

Outliers for the TradPed variable are among the lowest evaluations (these can be seen on the boxplot). Although there are six outliers identified, none are extreme. Although they contribute to non-normality, I think it's important that this sentiment be retained in the dataset.

\textbf{Assumption of sphericity}

We will need to evaluate and include information about violations related to sphericity. Because these are calculated at the same time as the ANOVA, itself, I will simply leave this here as a placeholder.

Here's how I would write up the evaluation of assumptions so far:

\begin{quote}
We utilized one-way repeated measures ANOVA to determine if there were differences in students' evaluation of traditional pedagogy across three courses -- ANOVA, multivariate, and psychometrics -- taught in that order.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Repeated measures ANOVA has several assumptions regarding normality, outliers, and sphericity. Although we note some skew and kurtosis, particularly for the multivariate class, none exceed the critical thresholds of \textbar3\textbar{} for skew and \textbar10\textbar{} identified by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016}.

Let's start first with the sphericity test. Mauchly's test for sphericity was statistically significant, \((W = 0.878, p = 0.012)\). Had we not violated the assumption, our \emph{F} string would have been created from the data in the ANOVA section of the output : \(F(2, 138) = 2.838, p = 0.062, \eta^2 = 0.14\) However, because we violated the assumption, we need to use the degrees-of-freedom adjusted output under the ``Sphericity Corrections'' section; \(F(1.78, 122.98) = 2.838, p = 0.068, ges = 0.014\).

While the ANOVA is non-significant, because this is a homework demonstration, I will behave \emph{as if} the test is significant and continue with the pairwise comparisons.

For hand calculations, I will use the same dataframe (rm1wLONG\_df) as I did for the calculations with R and R packages.Before we continue:

\begin{quote}
You may notice that the results from the hand calculation are slightly different from the results I will obtain with the R packages. This was true in the lesson as well. Hand calculations and those used in the R packages likely differ on how the sums of squares is calculated. While the results are ``close-ish'' they are not always identical.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Should we be concerned? No (and yes). My purpose in teaching hand calculations is for creating a conceptual overview of what is occurring in ANOVA models. If this lesson was a deeper exploration into the inner workings of ANOVA, we would take more time to understand what is occurring. My goal is to provide you with enough of an introduction to ANOVA that you would be able to explore further which sums of squares type would be most appropriate for your unique ANOVA model.

Someone who codes in R could probably write a quick formula to do this -- in this case, I will take the time (and space) to copy each student's standard deviation into a formula that squares it, multiplies it by \(n-1\) and then sums all 70 of those calculations.

\chapter{Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{Mixed}}

\href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtz5cFLQl4KOBGvzZ9QezuAFfthNOh-3B}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

The focus of this lecture is mixed design ANOVA. That is, we are conducting a two-way ANOVA where one of the factors is repeated measures and one of the factors is between groups. The mixed design ANOVA is often associated with the random clinical trial (RCT) where the researcher hopes for a significant interaction effect. Specifically, the researcher hopes that the individuals who were randomly assigned to the treatment condition improve from pre-test to post-test and maintain (or continue to improve) after post-test, while the people assigned to the no-treatment control are not statistically significantly different from treatment group at pre-test, and do not improve over time.

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-8}}

There is just over one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional two hours.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-8}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-8}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate the suitability of a research design/question and dataset for conducting a mixed design ANOVA; identify alternatives if the data is not suitable.
\item
  Test the assumptions for mixed design ANOVA.
\item
  Conduct a mixed design ANOVA (omnibus and follow-up) in R.
\item
  Interpret output from the mixed design ANOVA (and follow-up).
\item
  Prepare an APA style results section of the mixed design ANOVA output.
\item
  Conduct a power analysis for mixed design ANOVA.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-7}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-7}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select from problems that vary in degree of difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Murrar and Brauer \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article has three variables (attitudes toward Arabs, attitudes toward Whites, and a difference score) which are suitable for mixed design ANOVAs. I will demonstrate a mixed design ANOVA with the difference score. I'll leave the other two variables for opportunities for practice.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a mixed design ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\section{Introducing Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{introducing-mixed-design-anova}}

Mixed design ANOVA is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at least two independent variables.
\item
  Termed ``mixed'' because

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    one is a between-subjects factor, and
  \item
    one is a repeated-measures (i.e., within-subjects) factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In essence, we are simultaneously conducting

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a one-way independent ANOVA and a
  \item
    a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The illustration below represents the simplest of the mixed ANOVA designs. This 2x2 ANOVA includes random assignment to the between-participants factor. In this case it represents a control (or comparison) condition to a treatment condition. The within-persons factor is pre-test and post-test.

By increasing the number of between-persons conditions or follow-up assessments, the mixed design ANOVA can quickly become more complex.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mixed/MixedDesign.png}
\caption{Illustration of a research design appropriate for a mixed design ANOVA}
\end{figure}

Especially when there is a significant interaction there can be numerous ways to follow up. We will work one set of analyses: simple main effects (condition within wave; wave within condition) and, when needed, conduct posthoc pairwise comparisons as follow-up. Other good options include identifying a priori contrasts and conducting polynomials (not demonstrated in this lecture).

\hypertarget{workflow-for-the-mixed-design-anova}{%
\subsection{Workflow for the Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{workflow-for-the-mixed-design-anova}}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mixed/mx_workflow.jpg}
\caption{Image of a workflow for mixed design ANOVA}
\end{figure}

The steps in working the mixed design generally include,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Exploring the data/evaluating the assumptions
\item
  Evaluating the omnibus test
\item
  Follow-up to the omnibus

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if significant interaction effect: simple main effects and further follow-up to those
  \item
    if significant main effect (but no significant interaction effect), identify source of significance in the main effect
  \item
    if no significance, stop
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Write it up with tables, figure(s)
\end{enumerate}

Assumptions for the mixed design ANOVA include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dependent variable should be continuous with no significant outliers in any cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check by visualizing the data using box plots and by using the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The DV should be approximately normally distributed in each cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check with Shapiro-Wilk normality test \emph{rstatix::shapiro\_test()} function and with visual inspection by creating Q-Q plots. The \emph{ggpubr::ggqqplot()} function is a great tool.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The variances of the differences between groups should be equal. This is termed the \textbf{sphericity assumption.} This can be checked with Mauchly's test of sphericity, which is reported automatically in the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} output.
\end{itemize}

The best way to address violations of these assumptions is not always clear. Possible solutions include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For 2- and 3- way ANOVAs, violations of the normality assumption might be addressed by removing extreme outliers or considering transformations of the data. Transformations, though, introduce their own complexities regarding interpretation. Kline's text \citep{kline_data_2016} provides excellent coverage of options.
\item
  A robust ANOVA option is available in the \emph{WRS2} package
\item
  If there are three or more waves/conditions and the sample is large, it may be possible to run a multilevel, model.
\item
  In the absence of alternatives, it may be necessary to run the mixed design with the violated assumptions, but report them.
\item
  \ldots.and more. Internet searches continue to offer new approaches and alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-7}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-7}}

This lesson's research vignette is from Murrar and Brauer's \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article that describes the results of two studies that evaluated interventions designed to reduce prejudice against Arabs/Muslims. We are working only a portion of the first study reported in the article. Participants (\emph{N} = 193), all who were White, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they watched six episodes of the sitcom \href{http://www.friends-tv.org/}{\emph{Friends}} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie}{\emph{Little Mosque on the Prairie}}. The sitcoms and specific episodes were selected after significant pilot testing. The researchers wanted stimuli that were as similar as possible while ensuring that the intervention-oriented sitcom would be capable of reducing prejudice. The authors felt that both series had characters that were likable and relatable and were engaged in regular activities of daily living. The Friends series featured characters who were predominantly White, cisgender, and straight. The Little Mosque series portrayed the experience of Western Muslims and Arabs as they lived in a small Canadian town. This study involved assessment across three waves: baseline (before watching the assigned episodes), post1 (immediately after watching the episodes), and post2 (completed 4-6 weeks after watching the episodes).

The study used \emph{feelings and liking thermometers}, rating their feelings and liking toward 10 different groups of people on a 0 to 100 sliding scale (with higher scores reflecting greater liking and positive feelings). For the purpose of this analysis, the ratings of attitudes toward White people and attitudes toward Arabs/Muslims were used. A third metric was introduced by subtracting the attitudes towards Arabs/Muslims from the attitudes toward Whites. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes toward Whites where as low scores indicated no difference in attitudes. To recap, there were three potential dependent variables, all continuously scaled:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{AttWhite}: attitudes toward White people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  \emph{AttArab}: attitudes toward Arab people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  \emph{Diff}: the difference between AttWhite and AttArab; higher scores reflect a greater liking for White people
\end{itemize}

With random assignment, nearly equal cell sizes, a condition with two levels (Friends, Little Mosque), and three waves (baseline, post1, post2), this is perfect for mixed design ANOVA.

\subsection{Data Simulation}\label{data-simulation-5}}

Below is the code used to simulate the data. The simulation includes two dependent variables (AttWhite, AttArab), Wave (baseline, post1, post2), and COND (condition; Friends, Little\_Mosque). There is also a caseID (repeated three times across the three waves) and rowID (giving each observation within each case an ID). This creates the long-file, where each person has 3 rows of data representing baseline, post1, and post2. You can use this simulation for two of the three practice suggestions.

First we inspect the means. We see that the baseline scores for the Friends and Little Mosque conditions are similar.

\subsection{Exploring data and testing assumptions}\label{exploring-data-and-testing-assumptions}}

We begin the 2x3 mixed design ANOVA with a preliminary exploration of the data and testing of the assumptions. Here's where we are on the workflow:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mixed/mx_Assumptions.jpg}
\caption{Image of the workflow showing that we are on the ``Evaluating assumptions'' portion}
\end{figure}

The are several critical assumptions in factorial ANOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cases represent random samples from the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is an issue of research design
  \item
    Although we see ANOVA used (often incorrectly) in other settings, ANOVA was really designed for the random clinical trial (RCT).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The DV is continuously scaled (i.e., assessed on an interval or ratio scale); this is a matter of research design.
\item
  The DV is normally distributed for each of the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    that is, data for each cell (representing the combinations of each factor) is normally distributed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Population variances of the DV are the same for all cells (i.e., homogeneity of variance assumption)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When cell sizes are not equal, ANOVA not robust to this violation and we cannot trust \emph{F} ratio.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If the repeated measures factor has three or more levels the population variance of difference scores computed between any two levels of a within-subjects factor is the same value regardless of which two levels are chosen; termed the \textbf{sphericity assumption}. This assumption is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    akin to compound symmetry (both variances across conditions are equal).
  \item
    akin to the homogeneity of variance assumption in between-group designs.
  \item
    sometimes called the homogeneity-of-variance-of-differences assumption.
  \item
    statistically evaluated with \emph{Mauchly's test.} If Mauchly's \emph{p} \textless{} .05, there are statistically significant differences. The \emph{anova\_test()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package reports Mauchly's and two alternatives to the traditional \emph{F} that correct the values by the degree to which the sphericity assumption is violated.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The covariance matrix of the DV is the same for all levels of the between-subjects factors (i.e., homogeneity of covariance matrix).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{are-the-model-residuals-normally-distributed-1}{%
\paragraph{Are the model residuals normally distributed?}\label{are-the-model-residuals-normally-distributed-1}}

We can formally investigate the normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test. In the case of multiple factors (such as is the case in mixed design ANOVA), the assumption requires a normal distribution in each combination of these levels (e.g., difference scores at baseline for participants in the Friends condition). In this lesson's 3 x 2 ANOVA, there are six such combinations. A cell-level analysis (i.e., testing for normal distributions within each combination of factor levels) has been demonstrated in \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA} and independent \protect\hyperlink{tIndSample}{t-test} lessons. To the degree that there are many factorial combinations (and therefore, cells), this approach becomes unwieldy to calculate, interpret, and report. Further, the cell-level analysis of normality is only appropriate when there are a low number of levels/groupings and there are many data points per group. As designs increase in complexity, researchers turn to the model-based option for assessing normality.

To do this, we first create an object that tests our research model. Because the model-based approach to calculating the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality requires an object created by the \emph{aov()} function from base R, I will quickly run this. For the moment, we will only peek at the ANOVA results to make sure it ran, but will save the interpretation until later.

\includegraphics{10-MixedANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf} So far so good -- our distribution of \emph{residuals} (i.e., what is leftover after the model is applied) resembles a normal distribution.

The Q-Q plot provides another view. The dots represent the residuals. When they are relatively close to the line they not only suggest good fit of the model, but we know they are small and evenly distributed around zero (i.e., normally distributed).

\hypertarget{is-there-evidence-of-outliers}{%
\paragraph{Is there evidence of outliers?}\label{is-there-evidence-of-outliers}}

The boxplot is one common way for identifying outliers. The boxplot uses the median and the lower (25th percentile) and upper (75th percentile) quartiles. The difference bewteen Q3 and Q1 is the \emph{interquartile range} (IQR). Let's revisit one of our boxplots to see if there are any dots above the whiskers.

The distributions look relatively normal with the mean well-centered. Given that we simulated the data from means and standard deviations, this is somewhat expected.

Outliers are generally identified when values fall outside these lower and upper boundaries. In the short formulas below, IQR is the \emph{interquartile range} (i.e., the middle 50\%, the distance of the box):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 1.5xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 1.5xIQR
\end{itemize}

Extreme values occur when values fall outside these boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 3xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 3xIQR
\end{itemize}

Using the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers} function we can identifier outliers, doubly grouped by our predictor variables.

While we have some outliers (where ``is.outlier'' = ``TRUE''), none are extreme (where ``is.outlier'' = ``FALSE''). We'll keep these in mind as we continue to evaluate the data.

If I had extreme outliers, I would individually inspect them. Especially if something looked awry (e.g., erratic responding extreme scores across variables) I might consider deleting them. In this mixed design ANOVA, a case will only be included in the final analysis if all three waves of data are present. Therefore, if we decided to remove case at rowID = 337, we would need to remove all three cases. That is, we would need to remove it by caseID = 144. This would decrease the number of rows/observations by 3.

Let's say that, after very careful consideration, we decided to remove the caseID = 144. We could use \emph{dplyr::filter()} to do so. In this code, the \emph{filter()} function locates all the cases where caseID = 144. The exclamation point that precedes the equal sign indicates that the purpose is to remove the case.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Murrar\_df \textless{}{-} dplyr::filter (Murrar\_df, caseID != \textquotesingle{}144\textquotesingle{})}
\end{Highlighting}

Once executed, we can see that this case is no longer in the dataframe. Because each person had three observations, this reduces the number of observations by 3. Although I demonstrated this in the accompanying lecture, I have hashtagged out the command because I would not delete the case. If you already deleted the case, you can return the hashtag and re-run all the code up to this point.

Because there is a between-subjects variable, we need need to evaluate the homogeneity of variance assumption. As before, we can use the Levene's test with the \emph{rstatix::levene\_test()} function. Considering each of the comparisons of condition within wave, there is no instance where we violate the assumption.

In this multivariate sample, the Box's M test evaluates if two or more covariance matrices are homogeneous. Like other tests of assumptions, we want a non-significant test result (i.e., where \emph{p} \textgreater{} .05). Box's M has some disavantages. Box's M has low power in small sample sizes and is overly sensitive in large sample sizes. We would unlikely make a decision about our data with Box's M alone. Rather, we consider it along with our dashboard of diagnostic screeners.

At this stage we are ready to draft the portion of the APA style writeup that evaluates the assumptions.

\begin{quote}
Mixed design ANOVA has a number of assumptions related to both the within-subjects and between-subjects elements. Data are expected to be normally distributed at each level of design. There was no evidence of skew (all values were at or below the absolute value of 0.32) or kurtosis (all values were below the absolute value of .55; \citep{kline_data_2016}). Similarly, results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that model residuals did not differ significantly from a normal distribution (\(W = 0.999, p = 0.953\)). Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated some outliers, but none at the extreme level. Because of the between-subjects aspect of the design, the homogeneity of variance assumption was evaluated. Levene's test indicated a violation of this assumption between the Friends and Little Mosque conditions at baseline (\(F[1, 191] = 3.973, p = .047\)). However, there was no indication of assumption violation at post1 (\(F[1, 191] = 0.141, p = .708\)), and post2 (\(F[1, 191] = 0.107, p = .743\)) waves of the design. Further, Box's M-test (\emph{M} = 3.209, \emph{p} = .073) indicated no violation of the homogeneity of covariance matrices. \emph{LATER WE WILL ADD INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPHERICITY ASSUMPTION.}

Having evaluated the assumptions (excepting sphericity) we are ready to move to the evaluation of the omnibus ANOVA. This next step produces both the omnibus test as well as testing the sphericity assumption. Conceptually, evaluating the sphericity assumption precedes the omnibus; procedurally these are evaluated simultaneously. The figure also reflects that decisions related to follow-up are dependent upon the significance of the main and omnibus effects.

\hypertarget{checking-the-sphericity-assumption}{%
\subsubsection{Checking the sphericity assumption}\label{checking-the-sphericity-assumption}}

We continue our evaluation of statistical assumptions by examining the Mauchly's test for sphericity. Fortunately, the Mauchly's is included with the results of the omnibus ANVOA. The sphericity assumption becomes important when there are three or more levels in the repeated measures factor. The assumption requires that the variance of difference scores computed between any two levels of a within-subjects factor is the same value regardless of which two levels are chosen. As with so many of our statistical tests of assumptions, we want the \emph{p} value to be \textgreater{} .05.

Mauchly's test (in the middle of the output) reports the result. Because our Wave variable has three levels and appears in the main and interaction effects. The results are identical and we didn't violate the sphericity assumption.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main effect for Wave: \(W = .99, p = .369\)
\item
  interaction effect for COND:Wave: \(W = .99, p = .369\)
\end{itemize}

We will be able to add this statement to our assumptions write-up:

\begin{quote}
Mauchly's test indicated no violation of the sphericity assumption for the main (\(W = .99, p = .369\)) and interaction (\(W = .99, p = .369\)) effects.
\end{quote}

If the \emph{p} vaue associated with Mauchly's test had been less than .05, we could have used one of the two options (Greenhouse Geyser/GGe or Huynh-Feldt/HFe). In each of these an epsilon value provides an adjustment to the degrees of freedom used in the estimation of the \emph{p} value.

When there are concerns about sphericity violations, there is also a multivariate approach that does not require the assumption of sphericity. The \emph{rstatix} package does include this analysis. There is also an option to use a multivariate approach when ANOVA designs include a repeated measures factor. In the \protect\hyperlink{RMmultiv}{appendix}, I included an example of the multivariate approach with a one-way repeated measures design using with the \emph{car} package.

\hypertarget{interpreting-the-omnibus-results}{%
\subsubsection{Interpreting the omnibus results}\label{interpreting-the-omnibus-results}}

We are interested in the output reported in rows 2, 3, 4. These include the:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main effect for condition: \(F(1, 191) = 13.149, p < .001, \eta^{2} = 0.023\)
\item
  main effect for wave: \(F(2, 382) = 0.273, p = .761, \eta^{2} = 0.001\)
\item
  condition:wave interaction effect: \(F(2, 382) = 5.008, p = 0.007, \eta^{2} = 0.017\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for condition \((F[1, 191] = 13.149, p < .001, \eta^{2} = 0.023)\), a non-significant main effect for wave \((F[2, 382] = 0.273, p = .761, \eta^{2} = 0.001)\), and a significant interaction effect \((F[2, 382] = 5.008, p = 0.007, \eta^{2} = 0.017)\).
\end{quote}

In the output, the column labeled ``ges'' provides the value for the effect size, \(\eta^{2}\). Recall that \emph{eta-squared} is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the dependent variable/outcome that can be explained in terms of the independent variable/predictor. Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

You may see different values (.02, .13, .26) offered as small, medium, and large -- these values are used when multiple regression is used. A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

With a significant interaction effect, we would focus on interpreting one or both of the simple main effects. Let's first look at the simple main effect of condition within wave option.

\hypertarget{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error-2}{%
\subsubsection{Planning for the management of Type I error}\label{planning-for-the-management-of-type-i-error-2}}

Controlling for Type I error can depend, in part, on the design of the follow-up tests that are planned, and the number of pairwise comparisons that follow.

In the first option, the examination of the simple main effect of condition within wave results in only three pairwise comparisons. In this case, I will use the traditional Bonferroni. Why? Because there are only three post omnibus analyses and the traditional Bonferroni's more restrictive control is less likely to be problematic.

In the second option, the examination of the simple main effect of wave within condition results in the potential comparison of nine pairwise comparisons. If we used a traditional Bonferroni and divided .05/6, the \emph{p} value for each comparison would need to be less than 0.008. Most would agree that this is too restrictive.

The Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017} offers a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/6 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

If we were to hand-calculate the Holm's, we would rank order the \emph{p} values associated with the 6 comparisons in order from lowest (e.g., 0.016) to highest (e.g., 1.000). The first \emph{p} value is evaluated with the most strict criterion (.05/6; the traditional Bonferroni approach). Then, each successive comparison calculates the \emph{p} value by using the number of \emph{remaining} comparisons as the denominator (e.g., .05/5, .05/4, .05/3). As the \emph{p} values increase and the alpha levels relax, there will be a cut-point where remaining comparisons are not statistically significant.

Luckily, most R packages offer the Holm's sequential Bonferroni as an option. The algorithm in the package rearranges the mathematical formula and produces a \emph{p} value that we can interpret according to the traditional values of \(p < .05, p < .01\) and \(p < .001\). I will demonstrate use of Holm's in the examination of the simple main effect of ethnicity of rater within photo stimulus.

\hypertarget{simple-main-effect-of-condition-within-wave}{%
\subsection{Simple main effect of condition within wave}\label{simple-main-effect-of-condition-within-wave}}

The figure reflects our path in the workflow. In the presence of a significant interaction effect we could choose from a variety of follow-up tests.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mixed/mx_SimpleMainA.jpg}
\caption{Image of the workflow showing that we are at the ``Simple Main Effects for Factor A within all levels of Factor B'' step}
\end{figure}

If we take this option we follow up with three \emph{t}-tests. Why? Because within each wave (the repeated measures factor), there are two conditions. Statistically, we could use one-way ANOVAs, however, using the \emph{rstatix::t\_test} function will allow us to map statistically significant differences on a subsequent figure. Here are the comparisons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  comparison of Friends and Little Mosque within the baseline wave
\item
  comparison of Friends and Little Mosque within the post1 wave
\item
  comparison of Friends and Little Mosque within the post2 wave
\end{itemize}

We will control for Type I error by requesting the traditional Bonferroni.

Note that the function is \emph{rstatix::t\_test}. Recall that \emph{t}-tests can be for independent samples or paired samples. The \emph{rstatix::t\_test} is for independent samples and therefore appropriate for comparing the Friends to LittleMosque conditions (from the between-groups factor, COND).

Finally, I have also specified \emph{detailed=TRUE}. This permits me to see the means (i.e., estimate and estimate 1) for the Friends and Little Mosque conditions, the sample sizes for each (i.e., n1, n2), the confidence interval around the true difference between the means (i.e, conf.low, conf.high), and that we used a two-sided \emph{t}-test.

We can begin to assemble the results. At each wave we are comparing the Friends and Little Mosque conditions.

You might wonder about effect sizes. The \emph{rstatix::pairwise\_t\_test} does not produce any. A commonly used effect size for \emph{t} tests is the Cohen's \emph{d}. This gives the degree to which means differ in the metric of standard deviations. Values of .02, .05, and .08 are interpreted as small, moderate, and large, respectively. We can use \emph{rstatix::cohens\_d}. A helpful feature of this function is that interpretive language is provided.

We can update our \emph{t} strings with this information.

Baseline: \(t(178.04) = -0.108, p = 0.914, d = -0.016\) Post1: \(t(190.49) = 4.182, p < 0.001, d = 0.602\) Post2: \(t(190.61) = 2.448, p = 0.015, d = 0.352\)

Producing a figure can be helpful in conceptualizing what we have first done. Because we used the \emph{rstatix} functions, we can easily integrate them into our \emph{ggpubr::ggboxplot()}. Let's re-run the version of the boxplot where ``Wave'' is on the x-axis (and, is therefore our grouping variable). Because I want the data to be as true-to-scale as possible, I have added the full, potential, range of the y axis through the \emph{ylim} argument. In order to update the ggboxplot, we will need to save it as an option. My object name represents the ``Condition within Wave'' simple main effect.

We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of condition within wave. A traditional Bonferroni was used to manage Type I error \citep{green_using_2017}. There was a non-statistically significant difference between conditions at baseline \((t[178.04] = -0.108, p = 0.914, d = -0.016)\) However there were statistically significant differences at post1 \((t[190.49] = 4.182, p < 0.001, d = 0.602)\) and post2 \(t[190.61] = 2.448, p = 0.015, d = 0.352\). We note that the effect size at post1 approached a moderate size; the effect size at post2 was small.

Below are the \emph{F} strings for the one-way ANOVAs the followed the omnibus, mixed design, ANOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Friends: \emph{F} (2, 194) = 1.759, \emph{p} = 0.175, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.012 (effect size indicates a small effect)
\item
  Little Mosque: \emph{F} (2, 188) = 3.392, \emph{p} = 0.036, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.072 (a moderate effect size)
\end{itemize}

Because each of these one-way ANOVAs has three levels, we need to follow with pairwise comparisons. However, because the oneway repeated measures ANOVA was non-significant for the Friends condition, we only need to report them for the Little Mosque condition. As you can see we generally work our way down to comparing chunks to each other to find the source(s) of significant differences.

You will notice that we are saving the results of the pairwise comparisons as an object. This allows us to update the object in combination with the boxplot we created earlier.

Note that in this follow-up, once we have arrived at the level of paired comparisons, we are using \emph{rstatix::pairwise\_t\_test}. Because wave (within condition) is repeated measures, we including the command, \emph{paired = TRUE}.

In order to manage Type I error, I have specified ``holm.'' The Holm's sequential Bonferroni offers a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/6 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

Consistent with the non-significant one-way repeated measures ANOVA, there were non-significant pairwise comparisons for the Friends condition.

Within the Little Mosque condition, we find a significant difference between baseline and post1 (\emph{t}{[}94{]} = 2.447, \emph{p} = .049), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 (\emph{t}{[}94{]} = 1.621, \emph{p} = .216) and post1 and post2 (\emph{t}{[}94{]} = -1.034, \emph{p} = .304)

We can use \emph{rstatix::cohens\_d} to calculate effect sizes. In the metric of standard deviation units, values of .02, .05, and .08 are interpreted as small, moderate, and large, respectively.

If we were to write up this result:

\begin{quote}
We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of wave within condition. There were non-significant difference within the Friends condition \((F [2, 194] = 1.759, p = 0.175, \eta^{2} = 0.012)\). There were significant differences with an effect size indicating a moderate effect in the Little Mosque condition \((F[2, 188] = 3.392, p = 0.036, \eta^{2} = 0.072)\). We followed up the significant simple main effect for with pairwiwse comparisons. At this level we controlled for Type I error with the Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017}. Within the Little Mosque condition, we found a significant difference between baseline and post1 \((t[94] = 2.447, p = .049, d = 0.343)\), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 \((t[94] = 1.621, p = .216, d = 0.222)\) and post1 and post2 \((t[94] -1.034, p = .304, d = -0.150)\).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{if-we-only-had-a-main-effect}{%
\subsection{If we only had a main effect}\label{if-we-only-had-a-main-effect}}

When there is an interaction effect, we do not interpret main effects. This is because the solution is more complicated than a main effect could explain. It is important, though, to know how to interpret a main effect. We would do this if we had one or more significant main effects and no interaction effect.

The figure shows our place on the workflow.

If we had not had a significant interaction, but did have a significant main effect for wave, we could have conducted pairwise comparisons for pre, post1, and post2 -- collapsing across condition.

Ignoring condition (Friends, Little Mosque), we do not see changes across time. This is not surprising since the \emph{F} test for the main effect was also non-significant \((F[2, 382] = 0.273, p = .761, \eta^{2} = 0.0014)\),

If we had had a non-significant interaction effect but a significant main effect for condition, there would have been no need for further follow-up. Why? Because there were only two levels the significant main effect already tells us there were statistically significant differences between Friends and Little Mosque \((F[1, 191] = 13.149, p < .001, \eta^{2} = 0.023)\).

\subsection{APA Style Write-up of the Results}\label{apa-style-write-up-of-the-results}}

As I looked across the different approaches to describing the results, I felt that the simple main effect of condition within wave best explained the findings.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{quote}
We conducted a 2 X 3 mixed design ANOVA to evaluate the combined effects of condition (Friends and Little Mosque) and wave (baseline, post1, post2) on a difference score that compared attitudes toward White and Arab people.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Mixed design ANOVA has a number of assumptions related to both the within-subjects and between-subjects elements. Data are expected to be normally distributed at each level of design. There was no evidence of skew (all values were at or below the absolute value of 0.32) or kurtosis (all values were below the absolute value of .57 \citep{kline_data_2016}). Similarly, results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that model residuals did not differ significantly from a normal distribution \((W = 0.999, p = 0.953)\). Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated some outliers, but none at the extreme level. Because of the between-subjects aspect of the design, the homogeneity of variance assumption was evaluated. Levene's test indicated a violation of this assumption between the Friends and Little Mosque conditions at baseline \((F[1, 191] = 3.973, p = .047)\). However, there was no indication of assumption violation at post1 \((F[1, 191] = 0.141, p = .708)\) and post2 \((F[1, 191] = 0.107, p = .743)\) waves of the design. Further, Box's M-test \((M = 3.21, p = .073)\) indicated no violation of the homogeneity of covariance matrices. Mauchly's test indicated no violation of the sphericity assumption for the main \((W = .99, p = .369)\) and interaction \((W = .99, p = .369)\) effects.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for condition \((F[1, 191] = 13.149, p < .001, \eta^{2} = 0.023)\), a non-significant main effect for wave \((F[2, 382] = 0.273, p = .761, \eta^{2} = 0.001)\), and a significant interaction effect \((F[2, 382] = 5.008, p = 0.007, \eta^{2} = 0.017)\).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of wave within condition. A one-way ANOVA indicated non-significant differences within the Friends condition \((F [2, 194] = 1.759, p = 0.175, \eta^{2} = 0.012)\). In contrast, there were significant differences in the Little Mosque condition \((F[2, 188] = 3.392, p = 0.036, \eta^{2} = 0.072)\). We followed up this significant simple main effect with pairwiwse comparisons. At this level we controlled for Type I error with the Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017}. Within the Little Mosque condition, we found a significant difference between baseline and post1 \((t[94] = 2.447, p = .049, d = 0.343)\), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 \((t[94] = 1.621, p = .216, d = 0.222)\) and post1 and post2 \((t[94] -1.034, p = .304, d = -0.150)\).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
As illustrated in Figure 1 difference scores were comparable at baseline. After the intervention, difference scores increased for those in the Friends condition -- indicating more favorable attitudes toward White people. In contrast, those exposed to the Little Mosque condition had difference scores that were lower from baseline to post1 and stayed at that same level at post2. Means and standard deviations are reported in Table 1.

In general, the results of our simulation mapped onto the findings. If you have access to the article I encourage you to examine it as you consider my observations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The authors started their primary analyses of Experiment 1 with independent \emph{t} tests comparing the Friends and Little Mosque conditions within each of the baseline, post1, and post2 waves. This is equivalent to our simple main effects of condition within wave that we conducted as follow-up to the significant interaction effect. It is not clear to me why they did not precede this with a mixed design ANOVA.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The results of the article are presented in their Table 1
  \item
    Our results were comparable in that we found no attitude difference at baseline
  \item
    Similar to the results in the article we found statistically significant differences (with comparable \emph{p} values and effect sizes) at post1 and post2
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With two experiments (each with a number of associated hypotheses) in a single paper there were a large number of analyses conducted by the authors. I think they designed tables and figures that provided an efficient and clear review of the study design and their findings.
\item
  This finding is exciting to me. Anti-racism education frequently encourages individuals to expose themselves to content authored/created by individuals from groups with marginalized identities. This finding supports that approach to prejudice reduction.

\section{Power in Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{power-in-mixed-design-anova}}

The package \href{https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/_media/grant/practical_statistica_interior_for_kindle.pdf}{\emph{wp.rmanova}} was designed for power analysis in repeated measures ANOVA.

Power analysis allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. Especially when we don't achieve significance, we may want to stop.

In the \emph{WebPower} package, we specify 6 of 7 interrelated elements; the package computes the missing element

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size (number of individuals in the whole study)
\item
  \emph{ng} = number of groups
\item
  \emph{nm} = number of repeated measurements (i.e., waves)
\item
  \emph{f} = Cohen's \emph{f} (an effect size; we can use a conversion calculator); Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively
\item
  \emph{nscor} = the Greenhouse Geiser correction from our ouput; 1.0 means no correction was needed and is the package's default; \textless{} 1 means some correction was applied
\item
  \emph{alpha} = is the probability of Type I error; we traditionally set this at .05
\item
  \emph{power} = 1 - P(Type II error) we traditionally set this at .80 (so anything less is less than what we want)
\item
  \emph{type} = 0 is for between-subjects, 1 is for repeated measures, 2 is for interaction effect; in a mixed design ANOVA we will select ``2''
\end{itemize}

As in the prior lessons, we need to convert our effect size for the \emph{interaction} to \(f\) effect size (this is not the same as the \emph{F} test). The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function to translate the \(\eta^{2}\) associated with the interaction effect to Cohen's \emph{f}.

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-8}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. At a minimum your data should allow for a 2 X 3 (or 3 X 2) design. At least one of the problems you work should have a statistically significant interaction effect that you work all the way through.

Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way (minimally a 2x3), mixed design, ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-2}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-2}}

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If mixed design ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210813)'' from 210813 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}

The Murrar et al. \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article has three dependent variables (attitudes toward people who are Arab, attitudes toward people who are White, and the difference score). I analyzed the difference score. Select one of the other dependent variables. If you do not get a significant interaction, play around with the simulation (changing the sample size, standard deviations, or both) until you get a significant interaction effect.

\textbf{Minimally, the data should allow the analysis of a 2 x 3 (or 3 X 2) design. At least one of the problems you work should have a significant interaction effect so that follow-up is required.}

I want to ask the question, what are the effects of intentional recentering on students evaluations of socially responsive pedagogy as they progress through three doctoral courses in statistics. My design is a 3 x 2 ANOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Within-subjects factor: student as they progress through ANOVA, multivariate, psychometrics
\item
  Between-subjects factor: recentering status of the class (Pre, Re)
\item
  Continuous DV: SRPed (socially responsive pedagogy)
\end{itemize}

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could choose a different dependent variable. I chose the socially responsive pedagogy subscale. Two other subscales include traditional pedagogy and valued by the student.}

\hypertarget{simulate-or-import-and-format-data-3}{%

Let's trim it to just the variables of interest

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mixt\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ (dplyr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(big, deID, Course, Centering, SRPed))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I want the course variable to be factor that is ordered by its sequence: ANOVA, multivariate, psychometrics.

I want the centering variable to be ordered: Pre, Re

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(mixt\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':  310 obs. of  4 variables:

 - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr> 
\end{verbatim}

Because R's default is to order alphabetically, the centering variable is correct. I just need to change the course variable.

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{mixt\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Course }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(mixt\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Course, }\AttributeTok{levels =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"ANOVA"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Multivariate"}\NormalTok{,}

\end{verbatim}

After checking the structure again, both are correct.

I want all of my analyses (i.e., testing of assumptions, descriptives, omnibus F, follow-up) to be with the same dataset. Because each of these analyses will use listwise deletion (i.e., deleting cases, potentially differing numbers, when there is missing data), I will take care of this now. Because this is a longitudinal analysis, I will do it in two steps.

The current dataset is is in \emph{long} form. This means each student has up to three rows of data. I will first delete rows that have any missing data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mixt\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{na.omit}\NormalTok{(mixt\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This took me from 310 observations to 299.

These analyses, though, require that students have completed evaluations for all three courses. In the chapter, I restructured the data from long, to wide, back to long again. While this was useful pedagogy in understanding the difference between the two datasets, there is also super quick code that will simply retain data that has at least three observations per student.

This took the data to 198 observations. Since each student contributed 3 observations, we know \(N = 66\).

We won't look at this yet, but simply focus on testing the assumption of normality. The next step is to extract the residuals.

The formal test of normality is the Shapiro-Wilk test:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{shapiro.test}\NormalTok{(mixt\_resid)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

    Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  mixt_resid
W = 0.85873, p-value = 0.000000000001378
\end{verbatim}

Our test result is \(W = 0.859, p < .001.\). The significant \emph{p} value indicates that we have violated the normality assumption. When cell sizes have at least 15 cases each and are roughly equivalent in size, ANOVA models are generally robust to this violation. None-the-less, we should keep it in mind.

We can plot the residuals to ``see'' how bad it is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{hist}\NormalTok{(mixt\_resid)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{10-MixedANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-59-1.pdf} Like the data itself, the residuals have a negative skew with a pile-up of scores on the ``high'' side.

\FunctionTok{qqnorm}\NormalTok{(mixt\_resid)}

\includegraphics{10-MixedANOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-60-1.pdf} Similarly, we see that the residuals sharply deviate from the diagonal at the top.

\textbf{Is there evidence of outliers? Are they extreme?}

There are 9 rows of outliers; none are extreme. Cross-referencing back to the boxplot, these are on the low side of evaluations. As an instructor, it seems important to retain the voices that rated socially responsive pedagogy lower than the other students. Although they contribute to non-normality, to exclude them would bias the data in a positive direction.

\textbf{Are the variances of the dependent variable equivalent across all combinations of the factors?}

3 Psychometrics     1    64     0.320 0.574 
\end{verbatim}

Levene's test indicated a violation of this assumption between the Pre and Re centering conditions in the multivariate class \((F[1, 64] = 4.787, p = 0.032)\). There was no indication of assumption violation for the ANOVA class \((F[1, 64] = 0.176, p = 0.676)\) nor the psychometrics class \((F[1, 64] = 0.320, p = 0.573)\).

Before moving on I will write up the portion of the APA results section that evaluates the assumptions:

\begin{quote}
We conducted a 2 X 3 mixed design ANOVA to evaluate students' evaluations of social responsive pedagogy as a function of centering stage (i.e., pre-centered and re-centered) across three doctoral statistics courses in professional psychology (i.e., ANOVA, multivariate, psychometrics; taught in that order).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Mixed design ANOVA has a numer of assumptions related to both the within-subjects and between-subjects elements. Data are expected to be normaly distributed at each level of the design. Relative to the thresholds identified by Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} there was no evidence of skew (all values were at or below the absolute value of 1.909) and kurtosis (all values were below the absolute value of 3.680). The Shapiro-Wilk test applied to model residuals provided a formal test of normality. The test result was \(W = 0.859, p < .001.\) and indicated a violation of the the normality assumption. Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the rstatix::identify\_outliers() function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated 9 outliers; none of these at the extreme level. All outliers were among the lowest student ratings of socially responsive pedagogy. We determined that it was important that the dataset retain these perspectives.

We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of centering within course.

In the \emph{WebPower} package, we specify 6 of 7 interrelated elements; the package computes the missing element

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size (number of individuals in the whole study)
\item
  \emph{ng} = number of groups
\item
  \emph{nm} = number of repeated measurements (i.e., waves)
\item
  \emph{f} = Cohen's \emph{f} (an effect size; we can use a conversion calculator); Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively
\item
  \emph{nscor} = the Greenhouse Geiser correction from our ouput; 1.0 means no correction was needed and is the package's default; \textless{} 1 means some correction was applied
\item
  \emph{alpha} = is the probability of Type I error; we traditionally set this at .05
\item
  \emph{power} = 1 - P(Type II error) we traditionally set this at .80 (so anything less is less than what we want)
\item
  \emph{type} = 0 is for between-subjects, 1 is for repeated measures, 2 is for interaction effect; in a mixed design ANOVA we will select ``2''
\end{itemize}

As in the prior lessons, we need to convert our effect size for the \emph{interaction} to \(f\) effect size (this is not the same as the \emph{F} test). The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function to translate the \(\eta^{2}\) associated with the interaction effect to Cohen's \emph{f}.

The focus of this lecture is analysis of covariance. Sticking with the same research vignette as we used for the mixed design ANOVA, we rearrange the variables a bit to see how they work in an ANCOVA design. The results help clarify the distinction between \emph{moderator} and \emph{covariate.}

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-9}}

There is about just about an hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, plan for an additional hour or two

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define a \emph{covariate} and distinguish it from a \emph{moderator.}
\item
  Recognize the case where ANCOVA is a defensible statistical approach for analyzing the data.
\item
  Name and test the assumptions underlying ANCOVA.
\item
  Analyze, interpret, and write up results for ANCOVA.
\item
  List the conditions that are prerequisite for the appropriate use of a covariate or control variable.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-8}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-8}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select from problems that vary in degree of difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. For this ANCOVA article, I take a lot of liberties with the variables and research design. You could further mix and match for a different ANCOVA constellation.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for ANCOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct an ANCOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main effects and engage in any follow-up testing
  \item
    interpret results in light of the role of the second predictor variable as a \emph{covariate} (as opposed to the moderating role in the prior lessons)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables

\section{Introducing Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)}\label{introducing-analysis-of-covariance-ancova}}

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) evaluates the null hypothesis that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  population means on a dependent variable are equal across levels of a factor(s) adjusting for differences on a covariate(s); stated differently -
\item
  the population adjusted means are equal across groups
\end{itemize}

This lecture introduces a distinction between \textbf{moderators} and \textbf{covariates}.

\textbf{Moderator}: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

\textbf{Covariate}: an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable. It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Understanding this difference may be facilitated by understanding one of the assumptions of ANCOVA -- that the slopes relating the covariate to the dependent variable are the same for all groups (i.e., the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption). If this assumption is violated then the between-group differences in adjusted means are not interpretable and the covariate should be treated as a moderator and analyses that assess the simple main effects (i.e., follow-up to a significant interaction) should be conducted.

A one-way ANCOVA requires three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV/factor -- categorical (2 or more)
\item
  DV -- continuous
\item
  covariate -- continuous
\end{itemize}

Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_one-way_2017} identified common uses of ANCOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Studies with a pretest and random assignment of subjects to factor levels. Variations on this research design include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    assignment to factor levels based on that pretest,
  \item
    matching based on the pretest, and random assignment to factor levels,
  \item
    simply using the pretest as a covariate for the posttest DV.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Studies with a potentially confounding variable (best when there is theoretical justification and prior empirical evidence for such) over which the researcher wants ``control''
\end{itemize}

Although it is possible to have multi-way (e.g., 2-way, 3-way) ANCOVA, in this lecture we will only work two, one-way ANCOVAs representing these common use cases.

\hypertarget{workflow-for-ancova}{%
\subsection{Workflow for ANCOVA}\label{workflow-for-ancova}}

Our analytic process will be similar to others in the ANOVA series. An ANCOVA workflow maps this in further detail.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prepare the data
\item
  Evaluate potential violation of the assumptions
\item
  Compute the omnibus ANCOVA, and follow-up accordingly

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If significant: follow-up with post-hoc comparisons, planned contrasts, and/or polynomial
  \item
    If non-significant: stopping.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

ANCOVA has four primary assumptions:

\textbf{Linearity}: The covariate is linearly related to the dependent variable within all levels of the factor (IV).

\textbf{Homogeneity of regression slopes}: The weights or slopes relating the covariate to the DV are equal across all levels of the factor.

\textbf{Normally distributed}: The DV is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. This assumption applies to every combination of the values of the covariate and levels ohttps://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/ancova-in-r/f the factor and requires them all to be normally distributed. To the degree that population distributions are not normal and sample sizes are small, \emph{p} values may not be trustworthy and power reduced. Evaluating this is frequently operationalized by inspecting the residuals and identifying outliers.

\textbf{Homogeneity of variances}: The variances of the DV for the conditional distributions (i.e., every combination of the values of the covariate and levels of the factor) are equal.

We are following the approach to analyzing ANCOVA identified in the Datanovia lesson on ANCOVA \citep{datanovia_ancova_nodate}.

\hypertarget{research-vignette-8}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-8}}

We will continue with the example used in the \protect\hyperlink{Mixed}{mixed design ANOVA lesson} The article does not contain any ANCOVA analyses, but there is enough data that I can demonstrate the two general ways (i.e., controlling for the pretest, controlling for a potentially confounding variable) that ANCOVA is used.

Here is a quick reminder of the research vignette.

Murrar and Brauer's \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article described the results of two studies designed to reduce prejudice against Arabs/Muslims. In the lesson on mixed design ANOVA, we only worked the first of two experiments reported in the study. Participants (\emph{N} = 193), all who were White, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they watched six episodes of the sitcom \href{http://www.friends-tv.org/}{\emph{Friends}} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie}{\emph{Little Mosque on the Prairie}}. The sitcoms and specific episodes were selected after significant pilot testing. The selection was based on the tension selecting stimuli that were as similar as possible, yet the intervention-oriented sitcom needed to invoke psychological processes known to reduce prejudice. The authors felt that both series had characters that were likable and relateble who were engaged in activities of daily living. The Friends series featured characters who were predominantly White, cis-gendered, and straight. The Little Mosque series portrays the experience Western Muslims and Arabs as they live in a small Canadian town. This study involved assessment across three waves: baseline (before watching the assigned episodes), post1 (immediately after watching the episodes), and post2 (completed 4-6 weeks after watching the episodes).

The study used \emph{feelings and liking thermometers}, rating their feelings and liking toward 10 different groups of people on a 0 to 100 sliding scale (with higher scores reflecting greater liking and positive feelings). For the purpose of this analysis, the ratings of attitudes toward White people and attitudes toward Arabs/Muslims were used. A third metric was introduced by subtracting the attitudes towards Arabs/Muslims from the attitudes toward Whites. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes toward Whites where as low scores indicated no difference in attitudes. To recap, there were three potential dependent variables, all continuously scaled:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AttWhite: attitudes toward White people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  AttArab: attitudes toward Arab people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  Diff: the difference between AttWhite and AttArab; higher scores reflect a greater liking for White people
\end{itemize}

With random assignment, nearly equal cell sizes, a condition with two levels (Friends, Little Mosque), and three waves (baseline, post1, post2), this is perfect for mixed design ANOVA but suitable for an ANCOVA demonstration.

\subsection{Data Simulation}\label{data-simulation-6}}

Below is the code I have used to simulate the data. The simulation includes two dependent variables (AttWhite, AttArab), Wave (baseline, post1, post2), and COND (condition; Friends, Little\_Mosque). There is also a caseID (repeated three times across the three waves) and rowID (giving each observation within each case an ID). You can use this simulation for two of the three practice suggestions.

Let's check the structure. We want

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rowID and caseID to be unordered factors,
\item
  Wave and COND to be ordered factors,
\item
  AttArab, AttWhite, and Diff to be numerical
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(Murrar\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   579 obs. of  7 variables:
 $ rowID   : Factor w/ 579 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ caseID  : Factor w/ 193 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ Wave    : Factor w/ 3 levels "Baseline","Post1",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

 $ Diff    : num  25.71 23.18 42.67 1.92 29.01 ...
\end{verbatim}

The structure looks satisfactory. R will automatically ``order'' factors alphabetically or numerically. In this lesson's example the alphabettical ordering (i.e., Baseline, Post1, Post2; Friends, LittleMosque) is consistent with the logic in our study.

If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv (``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. This is what I would do. \emph{Note: My students and I have discovered that the the psych::describeBy() function seems to not work with files in the .rds format, but does work when the data are imported with .csv.}

\section{Working the ANCOVA -- Scenario \#1: Controlling for the pretest}\label{working-the-ancova-scenario-1-controlling-for-the-pretest}}

So that we can begin to understand how the covariate operates, we are going to predict attitudes towards Arabs at post-test (AttArabP1) by condition (COND), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline (AttArabB). You may notice that in this analysis we are ignoring the second post-test. This is because I am simply demonstrating ANCOVA. To ignore the second post test would be a significant loss of information.

\hypertarget{preparing-the-data}{%
\subsection{Preparing the data}\label{preparing-the-data}}

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a pretest, we need three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Little Mosque conditions
\item
  DV that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at post1
\item
  Covariate that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at baseline
\end{itemize}

The form of our data matters. The simulation created a \emph{long} form (formally called the \emph{person-period} form) of data. That is, each observation for each person is listed in its own row. In this dataset where we have 193 people with 3 observation (baseline, post1, post2) each, we have 579 rows. In ANCOVA where we use the pre-test as a covariate, we need all the data to be on a single row.This is termed the \emph{person level} form of data. We can restructure the data with the \emph{data.table} and \emph{reshape2}()* packages.

\subsection{Evaluating the statistical assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-5}}

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  random sampling
\item
  independence in the scores representing the dependent variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    there is, of course, intentional dependence in any repeated measures or within-subjects variable
  \end{itemize}
\item
  linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
\item
  homogeneity of the regression slopes
\item
  a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
\item
  homogeneity of variance
\end{itemize}

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

\hypertarget{linearity-assumption}{%
\subsubsection{Linearity assumption}\label{linearity-assumption}}

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable. In our case this means that there is linearity between the pre-test (covariate) and post-test (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between covariate (our pretest) and the outcome (post-test1).

\includegraphics{11-ANCOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf} As in not surprising (because we tested a similar set of variables in the mixed design chapter), this relationship look like an interaction effect. Let's continue our exploration.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of regression slopes}\label{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes}}

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group. The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate. The plotted regression lines should be parallel.

Because the statistically significant interaction term is violation of homogeneity of regression slopes \((F [1, 189] = 4.297, p = .040, \eta^2 = 0.022)\) we should not proceed with ANCOVA as a statistical option. However, for the sake of demonstration, I will continue. One of the reasons I wanted to work this example as ANCOVA is to demonstrate that covariates and moderators each have their role. We can already see how this data is best analyzed with mixed design ANOVA.

\hypertarget{normality-of-residuals}{%
\subsubsection{Normality of residuals}\label{normality-of-residuals}}

Our goal here is to specify a model and extract \emph{residuals}: the difference between the observed value of the DV and its predicted value. Each data point has one residual. The sum and mean of residuals are equal to 0.

Once we have saved the residuals, we can treat them as data and evaluate the shape of their distribution. We hope that the distribution is not statistically significantly different from a normal one. We first compute the model with \emph{lm()} (lm stands for ``linear model''). This is a linear regression.

We do have one outlier with a standardized residual that has an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this. If this were ``for real'' I might more closely inspect these data. I would look at the whole response. If any response seemed invalid (e.g., random, extreme, or erratic responding) I would delete it. If the responses seemed valid, I \emph{could} truncate them to exactly 3 SEs or. I could also ignore it. Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} has a great section on some of these options.

Code for deleting outliers can be found in earlier chapters, including \protect\hyperlink{Mixed}{Mixed Design ANOVA}.

As noted by the suggestion of an interaction effect, our preliminary analyses suggests that ANCOVA is not the best option. We know from the prior lesson that a mixed design ANOVA worked well. In the spirit of an example, here's a preliminary write-up so far:

\hypertarget{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions-3}{%
\subsubsection{Summarizing results from the analysis of assumptions}\label{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions-3}}

\begin{quote}
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs expressed by the participant at post-test and covariate was the pre-test assessment of the same variable. A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable, \(F (1, 189) = 4.297, p = .040, \eta^2 = 0.022\). Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,\(W = 0.984, p = .026\). Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \(F(1, 191) = 3.515, p = .062\).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{calculating-the-omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Calculating the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{calculating-the-omnibus-anova}}

We are ready to conduct the omnibus ANOVA.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_omnibus.jpg}
\caption{Image of the ANCOVA workflow, showing our current place in the process.}
\end{figure}

\emph{Order of variable entry} matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the \emph{controlling for} language associate with covariates, we want to remove the effect of the covariate before we run the one-way ANOVA. With this ANCOVA we are asking the question, ``Does the condition (Friends or Little Mosque) contribute to more positive attitudes toward Arabs, when controlling for the pre-test score?''

In repeated measures projects, we expect there to be dependency in the data. That is, in most cases prior waves will have significant prediction on later waves. When ANCOVA uses a prior asssessment or wave as a covariate, that variable ``claims'' as much variance as possible and the subsequent variable can capture what is left over.

In the code below, we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from the condition (Friends or Little Mosque), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline.

The \emph{ges} column provides the effect size, \(\eta^2\). Conventionally, values of .01, .06, and .14 are considered to be small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

You may see different values (.02, .13, .26) offered as small, medium, and large -- these values are used when multiple regression is used. A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

In our case, we only have two levels of the categorical factor, so this run wouldn't be necessary. I included it to provide the code for doing so.

Not surprisingly (since this single pairwise comparison is redundant with the omnibus ANCOVA), results suggest a statistically significant difference between Friends and Little Mosque at Post1.

With the script below we can obtain the covariate-adjusted marginal means. These are termed \emph{estimated marginal means.} Take a look at these and compare them to what we would see in the regular descriptives. It is helpful to see the grand mean (AttArabB) and then the marginal means (emmean).

Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable, \(F (1, 189) = 4.297, p = .040, \eta^2 = 0.022\). Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,\(W = 0.984, p = .026\). Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \(F(1, 191) = 3.515 p = .062\).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There was a non-significant effect of the baseline covariate on the post-test \((F[1, 190] = 0.665, p = .416, \eta^2 = 0.003)\). After controlling for the baseline attitudes toward Arabs, there was a statistically significant effect of condition on post-test attitudes toward Arabs, \(F(1,190) = 26.361, p < .001, \eta^2 = 0.122\). This effect appears to be moderate-to-large. Given there were only two conditions, no further follow-up was required. As illustrated in Figure 1, results suggest that those in the Little Mosque condition \((M = 73.92, SD = 18.51)\) had more favorable attitudes toward Arabs than those in the Friends condition \((M = 59.02, SD = 21.65)\). Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.

\section{Working the ANCOVA -- Scenario \#2: Controlling for a confounding or covarying variable}\label{working-the-ancova-scenario-2-controlling-for-a-confounding-or-covarying-variable}}

In the scenario below, I am simulating a one-way ANCOVA, predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 as a function of sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque), controlling for the participants' attitudes toward Whites. That is, the ANCOVA will compare the the means of the two groups (at post1, only), adjusted for level of attitudes toward Whites

TO BE CLEAR: This is not the best way to analyze this data. With such a strong, balanced design, the multi-way, mixed design ANOVAs were an excellent choice that provided much fuller information than this demonstration, below. The purpose of this over-simplified demonstration is merely to give another example of using a variable as a \emph{covariate} rather than a \emph{moderator}.

\hypertarget{preparing-the-data-1}{%
\subsection{Preparing the data}\label{preparing-the-data-1}}

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a potentially confounding variable, we need three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Littls Mosque sitcom conditions.
\item
  DV that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Arabs at post1 (AttArabP1).
\item
  Covariate that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Whites at post1 (AttWhiteP1). \emph{Note} We could have also chosen attitudes toward Whites at baseline.
\end{itemize}

We can continue using the Murrar\_wide df.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-6}{%
\subsection{Evaluating the statistical assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions-6}}

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  random sampling
\item
  independence in the scores representing the dependent variable
\item
  linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
\item
  homogeneity of the regression slopes
\item
  a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
\item
  homogeneity of variance
\end{itemize}

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{linearity-assumption-1}{%
\subsubsection{Linearity assumption}\label{linearity-assumption-1}}

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable. In our case this means that there is linearity between the attitudes toward Whites (covariate) and attitudes toward Arabs (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between the covariate (attitudes toward Whites) and the outcome (attitudes toward Arabs).

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{11-ANCOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf} As we look at this scatterplot, we are trying to determine if there is an interaction effect (rather than a covarying effect). The linearity here, looks reasonable and not terribly ``interacting'' (to help us decide whether empathy should be a covariate or a moderator). More testing can help us make this distinction.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes-1}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of regression slopes}\label{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes-1}}

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group. The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate. The plotted regression lines should be parallel.

Preliminary analysis supported ANCOVA as a statistical option in that there was no violation of the homogeneity of regression slopes as the interaction term was not statistically significant, \(F (1, 189) = 1.886, p = .171, \eta^2 = 0.010\).

\hypertarget{normality-of-residuals-1}{%
\subsubsection{Normality of residuals}\label{normality-of-residuals-1}}

Assessing the normality of residuals means running the model, capturing the unexplained portion of the model (i.e., the \emph{residuals}), and then seeing if they are normally distributed. Proper use of ANCOVA is predicated on normally distributed residuals.

We first compute the model with \emph{lm()}. The \emph{lm()} function is actually testing what we want to test. However, at this early stage, we are just doing a ``quick run and interpretation'' to see if we are within the assumptions of ANCOVA.

The statistically significant Shapiro Wilk test indicate a violation of the normality assumption (\(W = 0.984, p = .029\)). As I mentioned before, there are better ways to analyze this research vignette. None-the-less, we will continue with this demonstration so that you will have the procedural and conceptual framework for conducting ANCOVA.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-variances-1}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of variances}\label{homogeneity-of-variances-1}}

ANCOVA presumes that the variance of the residuals is equal for all groups. We can check this with the Levene's test.

Contributing more evidence that ANCOVA is not the best way to analyze this data, a statistically significant Levene's test indicates a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances \((F[1, 191] = 4.539, p = .034)\).

\hypertarget{outliers-1}{%

We can identify outliers by examining the standardized (or studentized) residual. This is the residual divided by its estimated standard error. Standardized residuals are interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line.

There is one outlier with a standardized residual with an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this. If this were ``for real'' I might more closely inspect these data. I would look at the whole response. If any response seems invalid (e.g., random, erratic, or extreme responding) I would delete it. If the response seem valid, I \emph{could} truncate them to within 3 SEs. I could also ignore it. Kline \citeyearpar{kline_data_2016} has a great section on some of these options.

\subsubsection{Summarizing the results from the analysis of assumptions}\label{summarizing-the-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions}}

\begin{quote}
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. Preliminary anlayses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable \((F [1, 189] = 1.886, p = .171, \eta^2 = 0.010)\) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption. In contrast, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was statistically significant \((W = 0.984, p = .029)\). This means that we likely violated the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. Regarding outliers, one datapoint (-3.38) had a standardized residual that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. Further, a statistically significant Levene's test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \((F[1, 191] = 4.539, p = .034)\).
\end{quote}

Because the intent of this analysis was to demonstrate how ANCOVA differs from mixed design ANOVA we proceeded with the analysis. Were this for ``real research'' we would have chosen a different analysis.

\emph{Order of variable entry} matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the \emph{controlling for} language associated with covariates, we firstly want to remove the effect of the covariate.

In the code below we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from attitudes toward Whites at post1 (the covariate) and sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque).

The \emph{ges} column provides the effect size, \(\eta^2\) where a general rule-of-thumb for interpretation is .01 (small), .06 (medium), and .14 (large) \citep{lakens_calculating_2013}.

\includegraphics{11-ANCOVA_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-1.pdf} \textbf{Results}

\begin{quote}
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. We controlled for attitudes toward Whites. Preliminary analyses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable \((F [1, 189] = 1.886, p = .171, \eta^2 = 0.010)\) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption. In contrast, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was statistically significant \((W = 0.984, p = .029)\). This means that we likely violated the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. Regarding outliers, one datapoint (-3.38) had a standardized residual that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. Further, a statistically significant Levene's test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \((F[1, 191] = 4.539, p = .034)\).
\end{quote}

Because the intent of this analysis was to demonstrate how ANCOVA differs from mixed design ANOVA we proceeded with the analysis. Were this for ``real research'' we would have chosen a different analysis.

\begin{quote}
There was a non-significant effect of the attitudes toward Whites covariate on the attitudes toward Arabs post-test, \(F (1,190) = 0.014, p = .907, \eta^2 < .001\). After controlling for attitudes toward Whites, there was a statistically significant effect in attitudes toward Arabs at post-test between the conditions, \(F(1. 190) = 26.119, p < .001, \eta^2 = 0.121\). The effect size was moderately large. Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.

\section{More (and a recap) on covariates}\label{more-and-a-recap-on-covariates}}

Covariates, sometimes termed \emph{controls} are often used to gain statistical control over variables that are difficult to control in a research design. That is, it may be impractical for polychotomize an otherwise continuous variable and/or it is impractical to have multiple factors and so a covariate is a more manageable approach. Common reasons for including covariates include \citep{bernerth_critical_2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  they mathematically remove variance associated with nonfocal variables,
\item
  the \emph{purification principle} -- removing unwanted or confusing variance,
\item
  they remove the \emph{noise} in the analysis to clear up the clear up the relationship between IV and DVs.
\end{itemize}

Perhaps it is an oversimplification, but we can think of three categories of variables: moderators, covariates, and mediators. Through ANOVA and ANCOVA, we distinguish between moderator and covariate.

\textbf{Moderator}: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

\textbf{Covariate}: an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable. It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Bernerth and Aguinis \citeyearpar{bernerth_critical_2016} conducted a review of how and when control variables were used in nearly 600 articles published between 2003 and 2012. Concurrently with their analysis, they provided guidance for when to use control variables (covariates). The flowchart that accompanies their article is quite helpful. Control variables (covariates) should only be used when:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Theory suggests that the potential covariate(s) relate(s) to variable(s) in the currrent study.
\item
  There is empirical justification for including the covariate in the study.
\item
  The covariate can be measured reliably.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-9}}

The suggestions for homework differ in degree of complexity. I encourage you to start with a problem that feels ``do-able'' and then try at least one more problem that challenges you in some way. At a minimum your data should have three levels in the independent variable. At least one of the problems you work should have a statistically significant interaction effect that you work all the way through.

Regardless, your choices should meet you where you are (e.g., in terms of your self-efficacy for statistics, your learning goals, and competing life demands). Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANCOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct an ANCOVA
\item
  if the predictor variable has more three or more levels, conduct follow-up testing
\item
  present both means and coviarate-adjusted means
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-3}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-3}}

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If ANCOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210813)'' from 210813 to something else. Then rework Scenario\#1, Scenario\#2, or both. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}

I want to ask the question, what are the effects of intentional recentering on students' evaluations of socially responsive pedagogy in the multivariate (last) course as a function of centering status (i.e., pre versus re), controlling for the socially responsive evaluations in the ANOVA (first) course:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Continuous DV: SRPed (socially responsive pedagogy) in the multivariate (last) class
\item
  Between-subjects factor: recentering status of the class (Pre, Re)
\item
  Covariate: SRPed in the ANOVA (first) class
\end{itemize}

\emph{If you wanted to use this example and dataset as a basis for a homework assignment, you could choose a different dependent variable. I chose the socially responsive pedagogy subscale. Two other subscales include traditional pedagogy and valued by the student.}

The \emph{head} function shows that the multivariate scores are missing.

\textbf{Is there a linear relationship between the covariate and outcome at each level of the grouping variable?{}``}

This would mean that there is linearity between the evaluation in the first course (covariate/ANOVA) and last course (outcome/Multivariate) at each level of the independent variable (Centering status).

We can get a visual of this with a scatterplot (with regression lines) between the covariae and outcome.

The plot looks a little funny. This is likely because there are no values below 3(ish) for ANOVA when courses were re-centered. Although we are looking for a linear relationship, the angled lines suggest there could be an interaction effect. The previous lesson (when we included all three courses {[}ANOVA, psychometrics, multivariate{]}) showed that there was. Spoiler alert -- mixed design ANOVA is a better analysis for this question, but the data does allow me (statistically) to use it for a homework demonstration.

\textbf{Are the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable the same for each group?}

This would mean that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate. We can test this with an ANOVA model that specifies an interaction.

Curiously, the interaction term was not statistically significant \((F[1, 71] = 1.975, p = 0.164)\). This non-violation of the homogeneity of slopes assumption supports the use of ANCOVA.

\end{verbatim}

The Shapiro-Wilk test suggested that our residuals are not statistically significantly different from a normal distribution \((W = 0.972, p = 0.101)\).

ANCOVA further presumes that the variances of the residuals is equal for all groups. I can check this with the Levene's test.

A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for the groups \((F[1, 73] = 2.675, p = 0.106)\).

\textbf{Is there evidence of outliers? Are they extreme?}

I can identify outliers by examining the standardized (or studentized) residuals. These are interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line.

Here's write-up of what I've done so far:

\begin{quote}
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, centering stage, had two levels: pre-centered, re-centered. The dependent variable was students' evaluation of socially responsive pedagogy during the last statistics course (multivariate) and the covariate was the students' evaluation of the same variable during the first statistics class (ANOVA).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable, \((F[1, 71] = 1.975, p = 0.164)\). Further, the non-significant Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals \((W = 0.972, p = 0.101)\) indicated that the dependent variable was not statistically significantly different from a normal distribution and no outliers were identified. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups \((F[1, 73] = 2.675, p = 0.106)\).

Not surprisingly (since this single pairwise comparison is redundant with the omnibus ANCOVA), results suggest a statistically significant difference between the pre- and re-centered stages in the multivariate class.

\section*{Type I Error Defined}\label{type-i-error-defined}}


\emph{Type I error} is the concern about false positives -- that we would incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis (that we would say that there is a statistically significant difference when there is not one). This concern is increased when there are multiple hypothesis tests. This concern increases when we have a large number of pairwise comparisons.

Throughout the chapters, I noted the importance and relative risk of Type I error with each statistic and options for follow-up testing. Because there are so many options, I have provided a review and summary of each option in this appendix. For each, I provide a definition, a review of the steps and options for utilizing the statistic, and suggest the types of follow-up for which this approach is indicated.

\hypertarget{lsd-least-significant-difference-method}{%
\subsection*{LSD (Least Significant Difference) Method}\label{lsd-least-significant-difference-method}}


The LSD method is especially appropriate in the one-way ANOVA scenario when there are only three levels in the factor. In this case, Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2017} have suggested that alpha can be retained at the alpha level for the ``family'' (\(\alpha_{family}\)), which is conventionally \(p = .05\) and used both to evaluate the omnibus and, so long as they don't exceed three in number, the planned or pairwise comparisons that follow.

\hypertarget{traditional-bonferroni}{%
\subsection*{Traditional Bonferroni}\label{traditional-bonferroni}}


The \emph{traditional Bonferroni} is, perhaps, the most well-known approach to managing Type I error. Although the lessons in this OER will frequently suggest another approach to managing Type I error, I will quickly review it now because, conceptually it is easy to understand. We start by establishing the \(\alpha\alpha_{family}\); this is traditionally \(p = .05\).

Next, we determine how many pairwise comparisons that we are going to conduct. If we are going to conduct all possible comparisons, we could use this formula: \(N_{pc}=\frac{N_{g}(N-1)}{2}\), where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(N_{pc}\) is the number of pairwise comparisons, and
\item
  \(N_{g}\) is the number of groups.
\end{itemize}

In the one-way ANOVA research vignette, the COND factor had three levels: control, low, high. Thus, if we wanted to conduct all possible comparisons we would detrmine \(N_{pc}\) this way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{3}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3{-}1}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3
\end{verbatim}

Subsequently, we would compute a new alpha that would be used for each comparison with this formula: \(\alpha_{pc}=\frac{\alpha_{family}}{N_{pc}}\).

In the one-way ANOVA research vignette we would calculate it this way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{05}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.01666667
\end{verbatim}

If we were to use the traditional Bonferroni to manage Type I error, the resultant \(p\) value would need to be \textless{} .017 in order for statistical significance to be claimed.

Luckily, each of these options has been reverse-engineered so that we do not have to determine the more conservative alpha levels. Instead, when we specify these options (and, as you will see, more) in the script, the \emph{p} value is adjusted and we can continue to use the customary \(p < .05, p < .01\) and \(p < .001\) levels of interpretation. In the case of the traditional Bonferonni, the \emph{p} value an be adjusted upward by multiplying it (i.e., the raw \emph{p} values) by the number of comparisons being completed. This holds the \emph{total} Type I error rate across these tests to be \(\alpha\) (usually 0.05). Further, most \emph{R} packages allow specification of one or more types of \emph{p} values in the script. The result is the Type 1 error-adjusted \emph{p} values.

Although the traditional Bonferroni is easy-to-understand and computer, it has been criticized as being too restrictive. That is, it increases the risk of making a Type II error (i.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). This is why the majority of follow-up options to ANOVA did not use the traditional Bonferroni.

\hypertarget{tukey-hsd}{%
\subsection*{Tukey HSD}\label{tukey-hsd}}


The Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference test) is a multiple comparison procedure used to identify significant differences between means of multiple groups. In the ANOVA context, it examines which specific pairs of groups differ from one another. The Tukey HSD was designed to control for Type I error. It does so by calculating the difference between the largest and smallest group means, then dividing this mean difference by the standard error of the same mean difference. The resulting statitic, \emph{q} has an associated Studentized Range Distribution. Critical values for this distribution come from a Studentized Range q Table and are based on based on the alpha level, the number of groups, and the denominator degrees of freedom (i.e., \(df_W\)).

The Tukey HSD (``Tukey's honestly significantly different'') test automatically controls for Type I error (i.e., false positives) by using the studentized range distribution to calculate a critical value. Subsequently, it compares the difference between pairs of means to this critical value. In the \emph{rstatix} package, the \emph{tukey\_hsd()} function will perform the t-tests of all possible pairwise combinations. The Tukey HSD \emph{p} value is automatically adjusted. In fact, there is nothing additional that can be specified about \emph{p} values (i.e., there are no other choice options).

I had intended to demonstrate this with the one-way ANOVA chapter, but could not get the results to render a figure with the significance bars and results. An online search suggested that I am not the only one to have experienced this glitch.

\hypertarget{holms-sequential-bonferroni}{%
\subsection*{Holms Sequential Bonferroni}\label{holms-sequential-bonferroni}}


The Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017} offers a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/9 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

If we were to hand-calculate the Holms, we would rank order the \emph{p} values associated with the 9 comparisons in order from lowest (e.g., 0.000001448891) to highest (e.g., 1.000). The first \emph{p} value is evaluated with the most strict criterion (.05/9; the traditional Bonferonni approach). Then, each successive comparison calculates the \emph{p} value by using the number of \emph{remaining} comparisons as the denominator (e.g., .05/8, .05/7, .05/6). As the \emph{p} values increase and the alpha levels relax, there will be a cut-point where remaining comparisons are not statistically significant. Luckily, most R packages offer the Holm's sequential Bonferroni as an option. The algorithm behind the output rearranges the mathematical formula and produces a \emph{p} value that we can interpret according to the traditional values of \(p < .05, p < .01\) and \(p < .001\). \citep{green_using_2017}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-9}{%
\section*{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-9}}


The research vignette for this example was located in Kalimantan, Indonesia and focused on bias in young people from three ethnic groups. The Madurese and Dayaknese groups were engaged in ethnic conflict that spanned 1996 to 2001. The last incidence of mass violence was in 2001 where approximately 500 people (mostly from the Madurese ethnic group) were expelled from the province. Ramdhani et al.'s \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} research hypotheses were based on the roles of the three ethnic groups in the study. The Madurese appear to be viewed as the transgressors when they occupied lands and took employment and business opportunities from the Dayaknese. Ramdhani et al.~also included a third group who were not involved in the conflict (Javanese). The research participants were students studying in Yogyakara who were not involved in the conflict. They included 39 Madurese, 35 Dyaknese, and 37 Javanese; 83 were male and 28 were female.

In the study \citep{ramdhani_affective_2018}, participants viewed facial pictures of three men and three women (in traditional dress) from each ethnic group (6 photos per ethnic group). Participant were asked, ``How do you feel when you see this photo? Please indicate your answers based on your actual feelings.'' Participants responded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicated ratings of higher intensity on that scale. The two scales included the following words:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Positive: friendly, kind, helpful, happy
\item
  Negative: disgusting, suspicious, hateful, angry

If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv (``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

The code for .csv will likely lose the formatting (i.e., making the Rater and Photo variables factors), but it is easy to view in Excel.

\section*{Analysis of Simple Main Effects with Orthogonal Contrasts}\label{analysis-of-simple-main-effects-with-orthogonal-contrasts}}


This example follows a significant interaction effect. Specifically, we will analyze the effects of ethnicity of rater (three levels) within photo stimulus (two levels). We will conduct two one-way ANOVAs for the Dayaknese and Madurese photos, separately. In this example, we will utilize orthogonal contrast-coding for rater ethnicity.

In the lesson on \protect\hyperlink{between}{factorial ANOVA} I used the \emph{rstatix} package. I am not aware of a way to do this type of analysis in \emph{rstatix}, therefore this worked example will use functions from base R and \_\_\_\_\_\_.

This is our place on the ANOVA workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_IntORTH.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow -- analysis of simple main effects of factor A within levels of factor B with orthogonal contrasts}
\end{figure}

Among the requirements for orthogonal contrasts are these critical ones:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there be one fewer contrast than the number of groups, (i.e., \emph{k} -1), and
\item
  once a group is singled out, it cannot be compared again.
\end{itemize}

Thus, with a limit of two contrasts I want to compare the

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Javanese to the Dayaknese and Madurese combined (asking, ``Do the Javanese evaluations of the photo differ from the combined Dyaknese/Madurese evaluations?''), then
\item
  Dayaknese to Madurese (asking, ``Do the Dayknese and Madurese evaluations of the photos differ from each other?'')
\end{itemize}

Such contrasts should be theoretically or rationally defensible. In the case of none, low, and hihigh dose/intervention/exposure designs this is an easy requirement to meet. Typically, the no-dose is compared to the combined low and high dosage conditions. Then the low and high dosage conditions are compared. I would argue that because the Javanese were observers to the conflict, we can single them out in the first contrast, then compare the two groups who were directly involved in the conflict.

It helps to know what the default contrast codes are; we can get that information with the \emph{contrasts()} function.

\begin{Shaded}

Madurese         0        1
\end{verbatim}

Next, we set up the contrast conditions. In the code below,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  c1 indicates that the Javanese (noted as -2) are compared to the Dayaknese (1) and Madurese (1)
\item
  c2 indicates that the Dayaknese (-1) and Madurese (1) are compared; Javanese (0) is removed from the contrast.

With this output we can confirm that, in contrast 1 (the first column) we are comparing the Javanese to the combined Dayaknese and Madurese. In contrast 2 (the second column) we are comparing the Dayaknese to the Madurese.

We will conduct these contrasts with one group at a time. First, we must create a subset of all observations of the Dayaknese photo:

Next we use the \emph{aov()} function from base R for the one-way ANOVA. Like magic, the contrast that we specified is assigned to the Rater variable. We can apply the \emph{summary()} function to the \emph{aov()} object that we created to see the results.

In this series of analyses we did not have an opportunity to ``let R manage Type I error for us.'' Therefore, we will need to do it manually. We had 4 follow-up contrasts (2 for Dayaknese, 2 for Madurese). Using a traditional Bonferroni we could control Type I error with .05/4 = .0125

\textbf{APA Write-up of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within rater ethnicity.}

This would be added to the write-up of the omnibus two-way ANOVA test.

\begin{quote}
To explore the interaction effect, we followed with tests of simple effect of rater ethnicity within the photo stimulus. That is, we examined the effect of each each rater's ethnicity within the Madurese and Dayaknese photo stimulus, separately. Our first analysis evaluated the effect of the rater's ethnicity when evaluating the Dayaknese photo; our second analysis evaluated effect of the rater's ethnicity when evaluating the Madurese photo. To control for Type I error across the two simple main effects, we set alpha at .0125 (.05/4). The simple main effect evaluating differences between rater ethnicity when evaluating photos of Dayaknese ethnic group was statistically significant: \(F(2, 51) = 13.32, p < .001, \eta ^{2} = 0.343\). Follow-up testing indicated non-significant differences when the ratings from members of the Javanese ethnic group were compared to the Dayaknese and Madurese, combined \((F [1, 51] = 0.095, p = .759)\). There was a statistically significant difference when Dayaknese and Madurese raters were compared \((F [1, 51] =26.554, p < .001)\). The simple main effect evaluating differences between rater ethnicity when evaluating photos of Madurese ethnic group was not statistically significant: \(F(2, 54) = 0.679, p = .512, \eta ^{2} = 0.024\). Correspondingly, follow-up testing indicated non-significant differences when the ratings of the Javanese were compared to Dayaknese and Madurese, combined \((F[1, 54] = 1.008, p = .320)\) and when the ratings of the Dayaknese and Madurese were compared \((F[1, 54] = 0.349, p = .557)\). This moderating effect of ethnicity of the rater on the negative reaction to the photo stimulus is illustrated in Figure 1.

\section*{Analysis of Simple Main Effects with a Polynomial Trend}\label{analysis-of-simple-main-effects-with-a-polynomial-trend}}


In the context of the significant interaction effect, we might be interested in polynomial trends for any simple main effects where three or more cells are compared.

Why? If there are only two cells being compared, then the significance of that has already been tested and if significant, it is also a significant linear effect (because the shape between any two points is a line).

Here is where we are in the workflow:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_Poly.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

At the outset, let me acknowledge that this is not the best example to demonstrate a polynomial trend. Why? We do not necessarily have an ordered prediction across categories for this vignette. Other research scenarios (e.g., when dosage, intervention, or exposure is none, low, high) are more readily suited for this analytic strategy.

In our example, Rater has three groups. Thus, we could evaluate a polynomial for the simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within photo stimulus. That is, we conduct polynomial analyses separately for the Dayaknese and Madurese photo stimuli.

If you haven't already, we need to subset the data, creating separate datasets for the evaluations of the Dayaknese photos and Madurese photos:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Dayaknese\_Ph }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{subset}\NormalTok{(Ramdhani\_df, Photo }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"Dayaknese"}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We will work the entire contrast for each of the datasets, separately.

First, we assign the polynomial contrast to the Rater variable. This is easily accomplished because the \emph{contr.poly(\#)} argument is built into base R. We simply indicate the number of levels in the variable. With Javanese, Dayaknese, and Madurese ethnic groups, we have three.

Second, we calculate the one-way ANOVA. Because we are using the \emph{aov()} function in base R, we will need to extract the results. This time we need to use the \emph{summary.lm()} function.

We are interested in the regression output that end in the extensions ``.L'' (for linear trend) and ``.Q'' (for quadratic trend). In the event that more than one polynomial trend is significant, select the higher one. For example, if both linear and quadratic are selected, interpret the quadratic trend

Results of polynomial trend analysis indicated a statistically significant linear trend for evaluation of the Dayaknese photos across the three raters \(t(51) = 5.153, p < .001\).

Results of a polynomial trend analyses were non-significant when ethnicity of the rater was evaluated when rating Madurese photos. Compared to the significant linear trend for the Dayaknese photos, results for ratings of the Madurese photos were non-significant (\(t[54] = 0.591, p = 0.557\)).

Here's how I might write up the results. In the case of polynomials, I will sometimes add them to an analysis that uses post hoc comparisons, particularly if the polynomial is helpful in conveying meaningful information about the result.

\begin{quote}
We followed up a significant interaction effect with a simple main effect of rater ethnicity within photo stimulus. Specifically, we were curious to see if there was a polynomial trend across rater ethnicity (ordered as Dayaknese, Javanese, and Madurese). Results indicated a statistically significant linear trend for evaluation of the Dayaknese photos \(t(51) = 5.153, p < .001\), but not for the Madurese photos (\(t[54] = 0.591, p = 0.557\)).
\end{quote}

The figure we have been using would be appropriate to illustrate the significant linear trend.

\section*{All Possible Post Hoc Comparisons}\label{all-possible-post-hoc-comparisons}}


Another option is the comparison possible cells. These are termed \emph{post hoc comparisons.} They are an alternative to simple main effects; you would not report both. A potential criticism of this approach is that it is atheoretical. Without compelling justification, reviewers may criticize this approach as ``fishing,'' ``p-hacking,'' or ``HARKing'' (hypothesizing after results are known). None-the-less, particularly when our results are not as expected, I do think having these tools available can be a helpful resource.

The figure shows our place on the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.

As the numbers of levels increase, post hoc comparisons become somewhat unwieldy. Even though this procedure produces them all, you can select which sensible number you want to compare and control for Type I error according to the number in that set.

With rater ethnicity (3 levels) and photo stimulus (2 levels), we have 6 groupings. When \emph{k} is the number of groups, the total number of paired comparisons is: k(k-1)*2

If we want to consider all 15 pairwise comparisons and also control for Type I error, a Holm's sequential Bonferroni \citep{green_using_2017} will help us take a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/15 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

With the Holms, we rank order the \emph{p} values associated with the 15 comparisons in order from lowest (e.g., .0000018) to highest (e.g., 1.000). The first \emph{p} value is evaluated with the most strict criterion (.05/15; the traditional Bonferonni approach). Then, each successive comparison calculates the \emph{p} value by using the number of \emph{remaining} comparisons as the denominator (e.g., .05/14, .05/13, .05/12). As the \emph{p} values rise and the alpha levels relax, there will be a cut-point where remaining comparisons are not statistically significant.

In Excel, I would sort my results by their \emph{p} values (low to high) and consider my threshold (\emph{p} \textless{} .0033) to determine which effects were statistically significant. Using the strictest criteria of \emph{p} \textless{} .0033, we would have four statistically significant values.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/Holmsequential.jpg}
\caption{Image of the results of the Holms sequential Bonferroni.}
\end{figure}

I would ask, ``Is this what we want?'' Similar to the simple main effects we just tested, I am interested in two sets of comparisons:

First, how are the two sets of photos (Madurese and Dayaknese) rated within each set of raters.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Javanese:Madurese - Javanese:Dayaknese
\item
  Dayaknese:Madurese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\item
  Madurese:Madurese - Madurese:Dayaknese
\end{itemize}

Second, focused on each photo, what are the relative ratings.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Javanese:Madurese - Dayaknese:Madurese
\item
  Madurese: Madurese - Dayaknese:Madurese
\item
  Javanese:Dayaknese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\item
  Madurese: Dayaknese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\end{itemize}

This is only seven sets of comparisons and would considerably reduce the alpha:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

Below I have greyed-out the comparisons that are less interesting to me and left the seven that are my focal interest. I have highlighted in green the two comparisons that are statistically significant based on the Holms' sequential criteria. In this case, it does not make any difference in our interpretation of these focal predictors.

\includegraphics{images/factorial/HolmsSelect.jpg} Given that my ``tinkering around'' analysis resembles the results of the simple main effects analyses in the \protect\hyperlink{between}{factorial lessonn}, I will not write this up as an APA style results section, but rather offer this is as a set of tools when you would like to explore the data in an atheoretical manner.

As noted in the lesson on \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{one-way repeated measures ANOVA}, the researcher can use a univariate or multivariate approach to analyzing the data. The \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} is limited to the univariate approach. In order to maintain a streamlined chapter with minimal distractions to student learning I have chosen to provide a quick and separate demonstration of the multivariate approach in this appendix. In-so-doing, I will use the \emph{car} package.

As a quick reminder, I will describe and resimulate the data. The narration will presume familiarity with the \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{one-way repeated measures ANOVA} lesson.

Amodeo \citep{amodeo_empowering_2018} and colleagues conducted a mixed methods study (qualitative and quantitative) to evaluate the effectiveness of an empowerment, peer-group-based, intervention with participants (\emph{N} = 8) who experienced transphobic episodes. Focus groups used qualitative methods to summarize emergent themes from the program (identity affirmation, self-acceptance, group as support) and a one-way, repeated measures ANOVA provided evidence of increased resilience from pre to three-month followup.

Eight participants (seven transgender women and one genderqueer person) participated in the intervention. The mean age was 28.5 (\emph{SD} = 5.85). All participants were located in Italy.

The within-subjects condition was wave, represented by T1, T2, and T3:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  T1, beginning of training
\item
  Training, three 8-hour days,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    content included identity and heterosexism, sociopolitical issues and minority stress, resilience, and empowerment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  T2, at the conclusion of the 3-day training
\item
  Follow-up session 3 months later
\item
  T3, at the conclusion of the +3 month follow-up session
\end{itemize}

The dependent variable (assessed at each wave) was a 14-item resilience scale \citep{wagnild_development_1993}. Items were assessed on a 7-point scale ranging from \emph{strongly disagree} to \emph{strongly agree} with higher scores indicating higher levels of resilience. An example items was, ``I usually manage one way or another.''

Without the \emph{rstatix} helper package, here is how the analysis would be run in the package, \emph{car.} Although this package is less intuitive to use, it results in both univariate output (both sphericity assumed and sphericity violated) and multivariate output (which does not require the sphericity assumption).

Evaluating the data requires that we create some objects that will be fed into function. We can name these objects anything we like.

In ths script below I define the objects that are required.

  waveLevels is an object that will specify three levels of the independent variable (pre, post, follow-up),

  waveFactor simply makes ``waveLevels'' a factor

The \emph{car::Anova()} function produces both univariate and multivariate results. To begin to understand this data, let's start with what we learned in the \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{one-way repeated measures ANOVA lesson}.

\hypertarget{univariate-results}{%
\subsection*{Univariate Results}\label{univariate-results}}


When we ran the univariate approach in the lesson, we first checked the sphericity assumption. Our results here are identical to those from \emph{rstatix::anova\_test}. That is, we did not violate the sphericity assumption: Mauchley's test \(= .566 p = 0.182\). Although I do not see the complete \emph{F} string, we learn that, if we had violated the sphericity assumption, that:

\begin{quote}
The Greenhouse Geiser estimate was 0.698 the corrected \emph{p} = .068. The Huyhn Feldt estimate was 0.817 and the corrected \emph{p} = .057.
\end{quote}

The univariate ANOVA results are under the ``Univariate Type III REpeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming Sphericity'' heading. We find the ANOVA output on the row titled, ``waveFactor.'' The results are identical to what we found in teh lesson: \(F(2,14) = 3.91, p = 0.045\). I do not see that an effect size is reported.

\hypertarget{multivariate-results}{%
\subsection*{Multivariate Results}\label{multivariate-results}}


Researchers may prefer the multivariate approach because it does not require the sphericity assumption. Stated another way, if the sphericity assumption is violated, researchers can report the results of the multivariate analysis.

We find the multivariate results in the middle of the output, under the heading, ``Multivariate Tests: waveFactor.'' There are four choices: Pillai, Wilks, Hotelling-Lawley, and Roy. Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_one-way_2017-1} have noted that in the one-way within-subjects ANOVA, all four will yield the same \emph{F} and \emph{p} values. They recommended reporting Wilks' lambda because researchers will have greatest familiarity with it. Thus, I would write up the result of this omnibus test like this:

\begin{quote}
Results of the one-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant wave effect, \(Wilks' \lambda = .597, F(2,6) = 2.022, p = 0.213\).
\end{quote}

Because follow-up testing is \emph{pairwise} (i.e., there are only two levels being compared), the sphericity assumption is not required and those could proceed in the manner demonstrated in the \protect\hyperlink{Repeated}{one-way repeated measures ANOVA lesson}.

\hypertarget{a-brief-commentary-on-wrappers}{%
\subsection{A Brief Commentary on Wrappers}\label{a-brief-commentary-on-wrappers}}

As noted several times, because of its relative ease-of-use, the relevance of information included in the results, and its integration with the \emph{ggpubr} package, I chose to use \emph{rstatix} package in all of the ANOVA lessons. As I worked through this example, I spent several hours creating and interpreting the code. For me, there was value in this exercise:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am encouraged and reassured with the consistency of results between the two approaches,
\item
  I am in awe of the power of these programs and a little intimidated by all the options that are available within a given package, and
\item
  I am deeply grateful to package developers who take the time to create packages for discipline-specific use-cases and then freely share their work with others. Thank you \href{https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix}{Alboukadel Kassambara}!
