\textbf{If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress. Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 13 Feb 2022}. Emerging volumes on other statistics are posted on the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/BikosRVT/ReCenter.html}{ReCentering Psych Stats} page at my research team's website.

\href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c932455e-ef06-444a-bdca-acf7012d759a}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

To \emph{center} a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., \emph{psych}, \emph{lavaan}) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license {[}CC BY-NC-SA 4.0{]}.

Training models for doctoral programs in health service psychology are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the \emph{scientist-practitioner-advocacy} training model, incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities \citep{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014}. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive?

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC{[}low-middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity,
\item
  the lesson's statistic is used in the article, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available.
\end{itemize}

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, ``A fish doesn't know that it's wet'' is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to \emph{changing the water} in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-1996), I learned that ``a foreign language'' was a graduation requirement. \emph{Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English.} This could have been met with credit from high school, but my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri's School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (FORTRAN, C++) -- but I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, ``SPSS for Windows'' would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook \citep{green_using_2014} that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (1947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine has been Dr.~Barbara Byrne's \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016}, ``Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.'' I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it. Dr.~Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr.~Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr.~Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the \href{https://www.academics4blacklives.com/}{Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative}. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics \& Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr.~Jhangiani's text \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

\hypertarget{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}{%
\section{What to expect in each chapter}\label{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}}

This textbook is intended as \emph{applied,} in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and \emph{writing them up} for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, \emph{hand-calculations} (using R to do the math for us) to provide a \emph{visceral feeling} of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic.

Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a \emph{workflow} through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a \emph{research vignette.} Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC {[}low middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or the data is available in a repository.
\end{itemize}

In each chapter we employ \emph{R} packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science.

\hypertarget{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}{%
\section{Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER}\label{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}}

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Simply follow along in your preferred format of the book (html, PDF, or ebook) and then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Locate the original documents at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{GitHub repository}. You can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open them to simply take note of the ``behind the scenes'' script
  \item
    copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
  \item
    clone a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub Desktop app} makes this easy!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
\item
  Each time the book is updated, new ebook and PDF versions are also pushed out. You can access these in the ``docs'' folder at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{GitHub repository}.
\item
  Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
  \item
    start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
  \item
    sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{if-you-are-new-to-r}{%
\section{If You are New to R}\label{if-you-are-new-to-r}}

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of tasks. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a ``scRiptuRe'' file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint.

\hypertarget{base-r}{%
\subsection{Base R}\label{base-r}}

The base program is free and is available here: \url{https://www.r-project.org/}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the installation, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically ``close to you.''
\item
  You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-studio}{%
\subsection{R Studio}\label{r-studio}}

\emph{R Studio} is the desktop application I use for R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environment: it lists the \emph{objects} that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Files}: Displays the file structure in your computer's environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  \item
    \emph{Packages}: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is ``on.'' You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window.
  \item
    The \emph{Viewer} and \emph{Plots} tabs will be useful, later, in some advanced statistics when we can simultaneously examine output and still work on script.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Primary window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R Studio runs in the background (in the \emph{Console}). Very occasionally, I find useful troubleshooting information in the Console.
  \item
    More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-hygiene}{%
\subsection{R Hygiene}\label{r-hygiene}}

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to ``skip this.'' However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting (and repeating, ad nauseum) to my students.

\hypertarget{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}{%
\subsubsection{Everything is documented in the .rmd file}\label{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}}

Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

\hypertarget{file-organization}{%
\subsubsection{File organization}\label{file-organization}}

File organization is a critical key to this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a project file folder.
\item
  Put the data file in it.
\item
  Open an R Markdown file.
\item
  Save it in the same file folder.
\item
  When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chunks}{%
\subsubsection{Chunks}\label{chunks}}

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is ``chunks.''

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

``Chunks'' start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did}
\CommentTok{\#here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code)}
\DecValTok{2021} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{1966}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 55
\end{verbatim}

Each chunk must open and close with a series of three tics. If one or more of the tics is missing, the chunk won't be read as such and the script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out comments to preserve annotations.

Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the ``r.'' These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks -- making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the ``Chunks'' tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles.

You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsubsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on \emph{packages} to do much of the work. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it. In this textbook form I have hashtagged out the command. Simply remove the hashtag to run it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#if(!require(psych))\{install.packages("psych")\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To make a package operable, you need to open it. There are two primary ways to do this. The first is to use the library function.

The second way is to place a double colon between the package and function. This second method has become my preferred practice because it helps me remember what package goes with each function. It can also prevent R hiccups when there are identical function names and R does not know which package to use. Below is an example where I might ask for descriptives from the psych package. Because I have not yet uploaded data, I have hashtagged it out, making the command inoperable.

\begin{Shaded}

There are exceptions. One is the \emph{tidyverse} package. Some of my script uses pipes (\%\textgreater\%) and they require tidyverse to be activated this is why you will often see me call the tidyverse package with the \emph{library()} function (as demonstrated above.)

If you type in your own ``install.packages'' code, hashtag it out once it's been installed. It can be problematic to re-run this code.

An incredible feature of R Markdown is its capacity to \emph{knit} to HTML, PowerPoint, or Word. If you access the .rmd files for this OER, you can annotate, revise, or remix them to suit your purposes.

\hypertarget{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}{%
\subsection{tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown}\label{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}}

Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In an R script, you must have everything in order: Every. Single. Time.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package.
  \item
    If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any \emph{prerequisite} script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  \item
    If you get lost, clear your global environment with the broom icon, then start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are a best practice.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small.
\item
  Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, you'll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The package isn't loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages). Using the double colon procedure to open a package (i.e., \emph{package::function()}) can mitigate this problem.
  \item
    The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data.
  \item
    There are errors in punctuation or spelling.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer)
\item
  If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df)). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success}{%
\subsection{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially when it is \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?).
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, and so forth.\\
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell \citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} taught us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are necessary, but can also be problematic. Sometimes updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term. I expect that prior scripts may need to be updated or revised with package updates and incongruencies between base R, R Studio, and the packages.
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. And square breathing. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

With the goal of creating a common, system-wide approach to using the platform, this lesson was originally created for Clinical and Industrial-Organizational doctoral students who are entering the ``stats sequence.'' I hope it will also be useful for others (including faculty) who are also making the transition to R.

There is about 45 minutes of lecture.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book.

\subsection{So many paRts and pieces}\label{so-many-parts-and-pieces}}

Before we download, it may be helpful to understand some of R's many parts and pieces.

The base software is free and is available \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{here}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the demo, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location -- and it should be geographically ``close to you.''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  \item
    You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}{R Studio} is the way in which we operate R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system:\\
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note} If you have an enterprise-owned machine (e.g,. in my specific context, if you are a faculty/staff or have a lab with institution-issued laptops) there can be complications caused by how documents are stored. In recent years we have found that letting the computer choose where to load base R, R Studio, and the packages generally works. The trick, though, is to save R projects (i.e., folder with .rmd files and data) into the OneDrive folder that syncs to your computer. If you have difficulty knitting that is unrelated to code (verified by getting a classmates or colleague to successfully knit it), it is likely because you have saved the files to the local hard drive and not OneDrive. If you continue to have problems I recommend consulting with your computer and technology support office.

\subsection{Script in chunks and everything else in the ``inline text'' sections}\label{script-in-chunks-and-everything-else-in-the-inline-text-sections}}

The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R. You can also hashtag-out comments so they won't run.

You can put almost anything you want in the ``inline text with simple formatting.'' Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

``Chunks'' start and end with with three little tics and will show up in a shaded box. Chunks have three symbols in their upper right. Those controls will disappear and your script will not run) if you have replaced them with double or single quotation marks or one or more of the tics are missing.

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

\hypertarget{managing-packages}{%
\subsection{Managing packages}\label{managing-packages}}

Note that I have hashtags in front my ``install.packages'' commands. This is because I have already installed them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You can run the script by temporarily removing the hashtag and running each command individually by placing your cursor at the end of the line of code and entering CNTRL/ENTER as a keyboard shortcut.\\
\item
  You can run the entire chunk by selecting the green arrow in the upper right of the chunk.
\item
  You can run all the script prior to any chunk by clicking the middle symbol (grey down arrow)
\end{itemize}

Once a package has been installed, replace the hashtag. It can be problematic to continue to re-run this code for installing packages (after they have already been installed).

To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#install.packages ("psych")}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{ (psych)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It takes awhile to learn which package is used for which task. A complete analysis (e.g., preliminary statistics, primary statistics, creating tables and figures) will require a number of packages. Many researchers like to list them all at in a complete section near the top of an .rmd file. In my lessons, I will include an ``install-if-needed'' section at the top that (hopefully) includes all the packages we use. My personal practice is to open the package by using double colons between the package name and function with each function that requires a package. For me this serves two purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It helps me remember (and continue to learn) which package is used for which task, and
\item
  (Possibly) helps prevent packages who share function names to not get confused with each other.
\end{itemize}

Below is an example of the script that will appear near the beginning of each lesson. When the hashtags are removed, it checks to see if these packages are available to the user.

\hypertarget{upload-the-data}{%
\subsection{Upload the data}\label{upload-the-data}}

When imported (or simulated) properly, data will appear as an object in the global environment.

In the context of this OER, I will be simulating data right in each lesson for use in the lesson. This makes the web-based platform more \emph{portable.} This means that when working the problems in the chapter we do not (a) write the data to a file and (b) import data from files. Because these are essential skills, I will demonstrate this process here -- starting with simulating data.

At this point, simulating data is beyond the learning goals I have established for the chapter. I do need to include the code so that we get some data. The data I am simulating is used in the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA lesson}. The data is from the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} random clinical trial.

In this simulation, I am simply creating an ID number, a condition (High, Low, Control), and a score on the dependent variable, ``Accurate.'' More information about this study is included in the \protect\hyperlink{oneway}{one-way ANOVA chapter}.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At this point, this data lives only in this .rmd file after the above code is run. Although there are numerous ways to export and import data, I have a preference for two.

\hypertarget{to-and-from-.csv-files}{%
\subsubsection{To and from .csv files}\label{to-and-from-.csv-files}}

The first is to write the data to a .csv file. In your computer's environment (outside of R), these files are easily manipulated in Excel. I think of them as being ``Excel lite'' because although Excel can operate them, they lack some of the more advanced features of an Excel spreadsheet.

In the code below, I identify the R object ``Acc\_sim30'' and give it a filename, ``to\_CSV.csv''. This filename must have the .csv extension. I also indicate that it should preserve the column names (but ignore row names; since we don't have row names).

This file will save in the same folder as wherever you are using this .rmd file.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to write it to an outfile as a .csv}
\FunctionTok{write.table}\NormalTok{(Acc\_sim30, }\AttributeTok{file=}\StringTok{"to\_CSV.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sep=}\StringTok{","}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{col.names=}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{row.names=}\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Importing this object back into the R environment can be accomplished with some simple code. For the sake of demonstration,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to save the df as an .csv (think "Excel lite") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}
\NormalTok{from\_CSV }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{ (}\StringTok{"to\_CSV.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{header =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The advantage of working with .csv files is that it is then easy to inspect and manipulate them outside of the R environment. The disadvantage of .csv files is that each time they are imported they lose any formatting you may have meticulously assigned to them.

\hypertarget{to-and-from-.rds-files}{%
\subsubsection{To and from .rds files}\label{to-and-from-.rds-files}}

While it is easy enough to rerun the code (or copy it from data prep .rmd and paste it into an .rmd you are using for advanced analysis), there is a better way! Saving the data as an R object preserves all the of its characteristics.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to save the df as an .rds file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}
\FunctionTok{saveRDS}\NormalTok{(Acc\_sim30, }\StringTok{"to\_Robject.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This file will save to your computer (and you can send it to colleagues). However, it is not easy to ``just open it'' in Excel. To open an .rds file and use it (whether you created it or it is sent to you by a colleague), use the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{from\_rds }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"to\_Robject.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you are the recipient of an R object, but want to view it as a .csv, simply import the .rds then use the above code to export it as a .csv.

\hypertarget{from-spss-files}{%
\subsubsection{From SPSS files}\label{from-spss-files}}

Your data may come to you in a variety of ways. One of the most common is SPSS. The \emph{foreign} package is popular for importing SPSS data. Below is code which would import an SPSS file \emph{if I had created one}. You'll see that this script is hashtagged out because I rarely use SPSS and do not have a handy file to demo.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#opening an SPSS file requires the foreign package which I opened earlier}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{quick-demonstration}{%
\section{quick demonstRation}\label{quick-demonstration}}

Let's run some simple descriptives. In the script below, I am using the \emph{psych} package. Descriptive statistics will appear for all the data in the dataframe and the output will be rounded to three spaces. Note that rather than opening the psych package with the library function, I have used the double colon convention.

\begin{Shaded}

Because ``ID'' is the case ID and COND is the factor (high, low, control), the only variable for which this data is sensible is ``Accurate.'' None-the-less, this provides an example of how to apply a package's function to a dataset. As we progress through the text we will learn how to manage the data so that we get the specific output we are seeking.

One of the coolest things about R Markdown is its capacity to \emph{knit} to HTML, PPT, or WORD.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this OER, I am writing the lessons in R markdown (.rmd files), with the package \emph{bookdown} as a helper, and knitting the files to the .html format. In prior years, I knitted these documents to .doc formats. There are numerous possibilities!
\item
  The package \emph{papaja} is designed to prepare APA manuscripts where the writing, statistics, and references are all accomplished in a single file. This process contributes to replicability and reproducibility.
\item
  If you are using the PDF or ebook version of this OER you will realize that it is also possible to render to these formats. Albeit slighy more complicated, this is possible, too!

  Most graduate psychology programs are scientist/practitioner in nature and include training in ``high end'' statistics. Yet, many of your employing organizations will not have SPSS. R is a free, universally accessible program, that our graduates can use anywhere.

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success-1}{%
\section{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially while it's \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (ask, ``Is the package activated?'' ``Are the data and .rmd files in the same place?'' ``Is all the prerequisite script run?'').
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by (retrieving the original.rmd file from the GitHub repository) opening a copy of the .rmd file and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does so you can translate it for any homework assignments. My suggestions for practice aspire to be parallel to the lecture with no sneaky trix.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, and so forth.\\
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell \citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} taught us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get great at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are necessary, but can also be problematic. Sometimes updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term. I expect that prior scripts may need to be updated or revised with package updates and incongruencies between base R, R Studio, and the packages.
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. And square breathing. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

The beginning of any data analysis means familiarizing yourself with the data, that is, its distributional characteristics as well as its relations.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-1}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-1}}

There is about 25 minutes of lecture.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-1}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Produce descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, skew, kurtosis), and correlation matrix, with the \emph{psych} package
\item
  Produce plots of data
\item
  Interpret skew, kurtosis, correlations
\item
  Create an APA Style table and results section that includes means, standard deviations, and correlations
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice}{%

\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette}}

We will use simulated data from Lui \citeyearpar{lui_racial_2020} for simple data screening. Controlling for overt discrimination, and neuroticism, Lui examined the degree to which racial microaggressions contributed to negative affect, alcohol consumption, and drinking problems in African American, Asian American, and Latinx American college students (\emph{N} = 713).

Using the means, standard deviations, correlation matrix, and group sizes (\emph{n}) I simulated the data. While the process of simulation is beyond the learning goals of this lesson (you can skip that part), I include it here so that it is easy to work the rest of the script.

If you have simulated the data, you can continue using the the ``Lui\_sim\_df'' object that we created. In your own research you may wish to save data as a file. Although I will hashtag it out (making it inoperable until the hashtags are removed), here is code to save the simulated data both .csv (think ``Excel lite'') and .rds (it retains all the properties we assigned to it in R) files and then bring/import them back into R. For more complete instructions see the \protect\hyperlink{Ready}{Ready\_Set\_R} lesson.

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#write the simulated data  as a .csv}
\CommentTok{\#write.table(Lui\_sim\_df, file="Lui\_CSV.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)}

\end{Highlighting}

\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file}
\CommentTok{\#df \textless{}{-} readRDS("Lui\_RDS.rds")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You may have noticed a couple of things in each of these operations

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First, I named the data object that global environment ``df'' (i.e., dataframe).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is a common (but not required) practice for researchers to simply use ``df'' or ``dat'' for their R script, no matter the type or source of the data. This practice has advantages (such as making the reuse of code quite easy) and disadvantages (it is easy to get confused about what data is what).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Second, if you run the code, the updating \emph{replaces} the prior code.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    While this is irrelevant today (we are saving the same data in different ways), it points out the importance of creating a sensible and systematic \emph{order of operations} in your .rmd files and then knowing where you are in the process.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Because the data is simulated, I can simply use the data I created in the simulation, however, I will go ahead and use the convention of renaming it, ``df.''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ Lui\_sim\_df}

Is this R session reading our variables correctly? Check it with the ``structure'' command.

  theoretically someone could experience no microaggressions, but it would still score as 1.0 if the scale is averaged and the respondent marked 1 (\emph{never}; and then \emph{not at all} {[}stressful{]}) for all the options.

Only the Race Ethnicity needs to be transformed from a character (``chr) variable to a factor. I will use the \emph{mutate()} function in the \emph{dplyr} package to convert the RacEth variable to be a factor with three levels.

It is possible to work with this data without restructuring them into a ``tiny df.'' However, this function is often one of the first skills we want to use so I will demonstrate it here.

Manipulating the data is an important skill. I can use the \emph{select()} function to retain three variables that are continuous and then obtain descriptive statistics about them.

We can start with simple descriptives. Revelle's \citep{revelle_introduction_2021} \emph{psych} package was made specifically for much of the type of work we do.

One of the easiest way to get ``counts'' of categorical variables is to use them in the \emph{psych} package's \emph{describeBy()} function. In the script below, I am asking for descriptives of the entire df, but disaggregated by RacEth.

\subsection{Determining Skew and Kurtosis}\label{determining-skew-and-kurtosis}}

To understand whether our data are normally distributed, we can look at skew and kurtosis. The skew and kurtosis indices in the \emph{psych} package are reported as \emph{z} scores. Regarding skew, values \textgreater{} 3.0 are generally considered ``severely skewed.'' Regarding kurtosis, ``severely kurtotic'' is argued anywhere \textgreater{} 8 to 20 \citep{kline_principles_2016}.

\hypertarget{splom}{%
\subsection{SPLOM}\label{splom}}

SPLOM (scatterplot matrix) is a graphical tool that uses multiple scatterplots to determine the correlation (if any) between a set of variables. These plots are organized into a matrix, making it easy to see them all at once.

In the \emph{psych} package, the \emph{pairs.panels()} produces these.

\textbf{On the diagonal} we see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  histogram of each variable
\item
  superimposed with a normal curve
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Below the diagonal} we see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  xy scatter plot (not useful for our categorical RacEth row)
\item
  the \emph{lowess} locally fit regression line
\item
  the X axis represents the column variable; the Y axis, the row variable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Above the diagonal} we see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pearson correlation
\end{itemize}

  The relationship between mAggr with nAff and psyDist is quite comparable
\item
  The relationship between nAff and psyDist is very strong

  Are these correlations significant? Revelle \citeyearpar{revelle_introduction_2021} is not a fan of the associated \emph{p} value, but we can get it several ways (hang tight).

Writing up an APA style results section frequently involves tables. A helpful package for doing this is \emph{apaTables}. An instructional article notes the contributions of tools like this contributing to the \emph{reproducibility} of science by reducing errors made when the author or analyst retypes or copies text from output to the manuscript. When the R script is shared through an open science framework, reproducibility is further enhanced \citep{stanley_reproducible_2018}.

We pass our tiny df to the \emph{apa.cor.table()} function of the \emph{apaTables} package. Commands allow us to specify what is included in the table and whether it should be displayed in the console or saved as a document to the project's folder.

These types of statistics are often presented in the preliminary results portion of an empirical manuscript. Here is how I might write them up.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

Our sample included Asian American (\emph{n} = 398), Latinx (\emph{n} = 182), and Black (\emph{n} = 133) participants. Visual inspection of the three variables of interest (negative affect, psychological distress, microaggressions) combined with formal evaluation of skewness and kurtosis suggested univariate normality. Correlations between negative affect and psychological distress were quite strong; correlations with each of these variables and microaggressions were moderate. Results are presented in Table 1.

The three exercises described below are designed to ``meet you where you are'' and allow you to challenge your skills depending on your comfort with statistics and R.

Regardless which you choose, you should:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a tiny\_df from a larger df
\item
  Calculate and interpret descriptives for the continuously scaled variables
\item
  Create the SPLOM (pairs.panels) of the continuously scaled variables
\item
  Use the \emph{apaTables} package to make an APA style table with means, standard deviations, and correlations
\item
  Write up a mini-results section (APA style)

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation (at the very top), then rework the lesson exactly as written. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.

\hypertarget{problem-2-swap-variables-in-the-simulation}{%
\subsection{Problem \#2: Swap Variables in the Simulation}\label{problem-2-swap-variables-in-the-simulation}}

One-way ANOVA allows the researcher to analyze mean differences between two or more groups on a between-subjects factor. For the one-way ANOVA, each case (i.e., individual, participant) must have scores on two variables: a factor and a dependent variable.

The factor must be categorical in nature, dividing the cases into two or more groups or levels. These levels could be ordered (e.g., placebo, low dose, high dose) or unordered (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, existential, psychodynamic). The dependent variable must be assessed on a quantitative, continuous dimension. The ANOVA \emph{F} test evaluates whether population means on the dependent variable differ across the levels of the factor.

One-way ANOVA can be used in experimental, quasi-experimental, and field studies. As we work through the chapter we will examine some some of the requirements (assumptions) of the statistic in greater detail.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-2}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-2}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate the statistical assumptions associated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
\item
  Describe the relationship between model/between-subjects and residual/within-subjects variance.
\item
  Narrate the steps in conducting a formal one-way ANOVA beginning with testing the statistical assumptions through writing up an APA style results section.
\item
  Conduct a one-way ANOVA in R (including calculation of effect sizes and follow-up to the omnibus).
\item
  Conduct a power analysis for a one-way ANOVA.
\item
  Produce an APA style results section.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-1}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-1}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Tran et al. \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} vignette has two variables where the authors have conducted one-way ANOVAs. I will demonstrate one (\emph{Accurate}) in this lecture; the second is available as one of the homework options.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions

The \emph{exceptionalizing racial stereotype} is microaggression framed as interpersonally complimentary, but perpetuates negative stereotypical views of a racial/ethnic group. We are using data that is \emph{simulated} from a random clinical trial (RCT) conducted by Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}.

The one-way ANOVA examples we are simulating represent the post-only design which investigated three levels of the exceptionalizing stereotype in a sample of Asian American participants. This experimental design involved a confederate (posing as a peer) whose parting comment fell into the low racial loading, high racial loading, or control conditions.

\hypertarget{data-simulation}{%
\subsection{Data Simulation}\label{data-simulation}}

Simulating data for a one-way ANOVA requires the sample size (rnorm), mean (mean), and standard deviation (sd) for each of the groups \citep{crump_simulating_2018}. In creating this simulation, I used the data from Table 1 in the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} article. Having worked the problem several times, I made one change. The group sizes in the original study were 23, 22, and 23. To increase the probability that we would have statistically significant results in our worked example, I increased the sample sizes to 30 for each group. In this way we have a perfectly \emph{balanced} (equal cell sizes) design.

\subsection{Preparing the Data}\label{preparing-the-data}}

Examining the data is important for several reasons. First, we can begin to inspect for any anomalies. Second, if we are confused about what statistic we wish to apply, understanding the characteristics of the data can provide clues.

In R markdown we can

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  look at the data by clicking on it, and
\item
  examine its structure with the \emph{str()} function.
\end{itemize}

Let's do both.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : chr  "High" "High" "High" "High" ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

If we look at this simple dataset, we see that we see that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{COND} is a grouping variable) with 3 levels (high, low, control)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``chr'' (character) format, it needs to be changed to be a factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Accurate} is a continuous variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``num'' (numerical) format, this is an appropriate format.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{moreTalk} is a continuous variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it is presently in ``num'' (numerical) format, this is an appropriate format
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are many ways to convert variables to factors; here is one of the simplest.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#convert variable  to factor}
\NormalTok{accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's recheck the structure

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : Factor w/ 3 levels "Control","High",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

By default, R orders factors alphabetically. This means, analyses will assume that ``Control'' (C) is the lowest condition, then ``High,'' then ``Low.'' Since these have theoretically ordered values, we want them in the order of ``Control,'' ``Low,'' ``High.''

Here is the script to create an ordered factor. The order in which the variables are entered in the concatenated list (``c'') establishes the order (e.g., levels).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#ordering the factor}
\NormalTok{accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(accSIM30}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{COND, }\AttributeTok{levels =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Control"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Low"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"High"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Again, we can check our work.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#another structure check}
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(accSIM30)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   90 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 90 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ COND    : Factor w/ 3 levels "Control","Low",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ Accurate: num  0.42 1.123 0.885 1.569 1.831 ...
 $ moreTalk: num  -0.64 -2 -0.25 0.146 -0.996 ...
\end{verbatim}

Now our variables are suitable for analysis.

At this point, you may wish to export and/or import the data as a .csv (think ``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object that preserves the information about the variables -- such changing COND to an ordered factor), here is the code to do so. The data should save in the same folder as the .rmd file. Therefore, it is really important (think, ``good R hygiene'') to have organized your folders so that your .rmd and data files are co-located.

I have hashtagged out the code. If you wish to use it, delete the hashtags. Although I show the .csv code first, my personal preference is to save R data as .rds files. While they aren't easy to ``see'' as an independent file, they retain the formatting of the variables. For a demonstration, refer back to the \protect\hyperlink{Ready}{Ready\_Set\_R} lesson.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#write the simulated data  as a .csv}
\CommentTok{\#write.table(accSIM30, file="accSIM.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)}
\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file}
\CommentTok{\#acc\_csv \textless{}{-} read.csv ("accSIM.csv", header = TRUE)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#a quick demo to show that the .csv format loses the variable formatting}
\CommentTok{\#str(acc\_csv)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}
\CommentTok{\#saveRDS(accSIM30, "accSIM.rds")}
\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file}
\CommentTok{\#acc\_RDS \textless{}{-} readRDS("accSIM.rds")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#a quick demo to show that the .rds format preserves the variable formatting}
\CommentTok{\#str(acc\_RDS)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that I renamed each of these data objects to reflect the form in whic I saved them (i.e., ``acc\_csv'', ``acc\_RDS''). If you have followed this step, you will want to rename the file before continuing with the rest of the chapter. Alternatively, you can start from scratch, re-run the code to simulate the data, and skip this portion on importing/exporting data.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{exploring-the-distributional-characteristics-numerically}{%
\subsection{Exploring the Distributional Characteristics Numerically}\label{exploring-the-distributional-characteristics-numerically}}

We will explore the data such that you will have several tools for future exploration. In this first demonstration I will quickly produce a mean and standard deviation.

These functions are in base R. The \emph{aggregate()} function lets R know we want output by a grouping variable. We then list the variable of interest, a tilda (I think of the word ``by''), and then the grouping variable (I think ``Accurate by COND''). Finally we list the dataframe and the statistic (e.g., mean or standard deviation). R is case sensitive to check your capitalization if your code fails to execute.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{aggregate}\NormalTok{(Accurate }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ COND, accSIM30, mean)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Before looking at graphs, we can see that racially loaded \emph{high} condition has the lowest accuracy score and the largest variability. Let's produce some helpful figures so that we can visualize this.

\hypertarget{exploring-the-distributional-characteristics-graphically}{%
\subsection{Exploring the Distributional Characteristics Graphically}\label{exploring-the-distributional-characteristics-graphically}}

The package \emph{gplots} produces a simple line graph and the script is fairly intuitive. The \emph{plotmeans()} function plots the means with error bars (95\% confidence intervals) around the mean. Regarding the confidence intervals, we can think, ``How confident are we that the mean is this particular value?'' Earlier we noted that the ``high racial loading condition'' had the lowest mean and the widest variability. Is this apparent from the graph?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Boxplots, with the \emph{boxplot2()} function provide another view of our data. In boxplots the center value is the median. The box spans the \emph{interquartile range} and ranges from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The whiskers cover 1.5 times the interquartile range. When this does not capture the entire range, outliers are represented with dots.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{ReCenterPsychStats_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-45-1.pdf}

From both the boxplot and the linegraph with error bars, we can see that participants in the low racial loading condition have the highest accuracy ratings. This is followed by the control and then high racial loading conditions. Are these differences statistically significant? This is why we need the one-way ANOVA.

\hypertarget{understanding-anova-with-hand-calculations}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Understanding ANOVA with \emph{Hand Calculations}}{Understanding ANOVA with Hand Calculations}}\label{understanding-anova-with-hand-calculations}}

ANOVA was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. The name is a bit of a misnomer -- rather than analyzing \emph{variances}, we are investigating differences in \emph{means} (but the formula does take variances into consideration\ldots stay tuned).

ANOVA falls squarely within the tradition of \textbf{null hypothesis significance testing} (NHST). As such, a formal, traditional, ANOVA begins with statements of the null and alternate hypotheses. \emph{Note. In their article, Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} do not list such.}

In our example, we would hypothesize that the population means (i.e., Asian or Asian American individuals in the U.S.) are equal:
\[H_{O}:  \mu _{1} = \mu _{2} = \mu _{3}\]
There are an number of ways that the \(H_{O}\) could be false. Here are a few:
\[H_{a1}:  \mu _{1} \neq \mu _{2} \neq \mu _{3}\]
\[H_{a2}:  \mu _{1} =  \mu _{2} > \mu _{3}\]
\[H_{a3}:  \mu _{1} >  \mu _{2} > \mu _{3}\]
The bottom line is that if we have a statistically significant omnibus ANOVA (i.e., the test of the overall significance of the model) and the \(H_{O}\) is false, somewhere between the three levels of the grouping factor, the means are statistically significantly different from each other.

In evaluating the differences between means, one-way ANOVA compares:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  systematic variance to unsystematic variance
\item
  explained to unexplained variation
\item
  experimental effect to the individual differences
\item
  model variance to residual variance
\item
  between group variance to within group variance
\end{itemize}

The ratio of these variances is the \emph{F}-ratio.

Navarro \citeyearpar{navarro_book_2020} offers a set of useful figures to compare between- and within-group variation.

\end{figure}

When between-group variance (i.e,. model variance) is greater than within-group variance (i.e., residual variance) there may be support to suggest that there are statistically significant differences between groups.

Let's examine how variance is partitioned by hand-calculating sums of squares total, model, and residual. Along the way we will use some basic R skills to manipulate the data.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-total}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Total}\label{sums-of-squares-total}}

Sums of squares total represents the total amount of variance within our data. Examining the formula(s; there are variants of each) can help us gain a conceptual understanding of this.

In this first version of the formula we can see that the grand (or overall) mean is subtracted from each individual score, squared, and then summed. This makes sense: \emph{sums of squares, total}.

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]
In the next version of the formula we see that the sums of square total is the addition of the sums of squares model and residual.

\[SS_{T}= SS_{M} + SS_{R}\]

``Between'' and ``within'' are another way to understand ``model'' and ``residual.'' This is reflected in the next formula.

\[SS_{T}= SS_{B} + SS_{W}\]
Finally, think of the sums of squares total as the grand variance multiplied by the overall degrees of freedom (\emph{N} - 1).

\[SS_{T}= s_{grand}^{2}(n-1)\]
Let's take a moment to \emph{hand-calculate} \(SS_{T}\). Not to worry -- we'll get R to do the math for us!

Our grand (i.e., overall) mean is

Subtracting the grand mean from each Accurate rating yields a mean difference.

Unless you run the script at the top of this document (``options(scipen=999)'') R will (seemingly selectively) use \textbf{scientific e notation} to report your results. The proper value is one where the base number (before the ``e'') is multiplied by 10, raised to the power shown: \(3.830065 * 10^{17}\) Another way to think of it is to move the decimal 17 places to the left. In any case, this number is essentially zero.

Back to the point of sums of squares total, the sum of deviations around the grand mean will always be zero. To make them useful, we must square them:

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 39.67818
\end{verbatim}

This value, the sum of squared deviations around the grand mean, is our \(SS_T\). The associated \emph{degrees of freedom} is \(N - 1\); in our case this is 90-1 = 89.

In one-way ANOVA, we divide \(SS_T\) into \textbf{model/between sums of squares} and \textbf{residual/within sums of squares}.

The \emph{model} generally represents the notion that the means are different than each other. We want the variation between our means to be greater than the variation within each of the groups from which our means are calculated.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-for-the-model-or-between}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares for the Model (or Between)}\label{sums-of-squares-for-the-model-or-between}}

We just determined that the total amount of variation within the data is 39.678 units. From this we can estimate how much of this variation our model can explain. \(SS_M\) tells us how much of the total variation can be explained by the fact that different data points come from different groups.

We see this reflected in the formula below, where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the grand mean is subtracted from each group mean
\item
  this value is squared and multiplied by the number of cases in each group
\item
  these values are summed
\end{itemize}

\[SS_{M}= \sum n_{k}(\bar{x}_{k}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]

To calculate this, we start with the grand mean (previously calculated): 1.603.

We also estimate the group means.

This value, \(SS_M\) is the amount of variance accounted for by the model; that is, the the amount of variance accounted for by the grouping variable/factor, COND. Degrees of freedom for \(SS_M\) is always one less than the number of elements (e.g., groups) used in its calculation (\(k-1\)). Because we have three groups, our degrees of freedom for the model is two.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Residual (or within)}\label{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within}}

To recap, we know there are 39.678 units of variation to be explained in our data. Our model explains 9.432 of these units. Sums of squares residual tells us how much of the variation cannot be explained by the model. This value is influenced by extraneous factors; some will refer to it as ``noise.''

Looking at the formula can assist us in with a conceptual formula. In \(SS_R\) we subtract the group mean from each individual member of the group and then square it.

\[SS_{R}= \sum(x_{ik}-\bar{x}_{k})^{^{2}}\]
Below is another approach to calculating\(SS_R\). In this one the variance for each group is multiplied by its respective degrees of freedom, then summed.

\[SS_{R}= s_{group1}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group2}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group3}^{2}(n-1))\]
Again, the formula is in three chunks -- but this time the calculations are \emph{within-group}. We need the variance (the standard deviation squared) for the calculation.

Our estimates of variation were \emph{sums of squares} and are influenced by the number of scores that were summed. We can correct this bias by calculating their average -- the \emph{mean squares} or \(MS\). We will use these in the calculation of the \(F\) ratio -- the statistic that tests if there are significant differences between groups.

Like the constellation of sums of squares, we calculate mean squares for the model (\(MS_M\)) and residual(\(MS_R\)). Each formula simply divides the corresponding sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom.

Earlier we used ``between'' and ``within'' language.

These last few calculations are actually less complicated than this presentation makes them seem. To better understand the relation between sums of squares, degrees of freedom, and mean squares, let's play a couple of rounds of \emph{Source Table Games}!

Rules of the game:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  In each case, mean squares are determined by dividing the sums of squares by its respective degrees of freedom.
\item
  The \emph{F} statistic is determined by dividing \(MS_M\) by \(MS_R\)

Knowing only two of the values, challenge yourself to complete the rest of the table. Before looking at the answers (below), try to the fill in the blanks based in the table based on what we have learned so far.

\(F = MS_{M}/MS_{R}\) = 13.566

To determine whether or not it is statistically significant, we can check a \href{https://www.statology.org/how-to-read-the-f-distribution-table/}{table of critical values} \citep{zach_how_2019} for the \emph{F} test.

Our example has 2 (numerator) and 87 (denominator) degrees of freedom. Rolling down to the table where \(\alpha = .05\), we can see that any \(F\) value \textgreater{} 3.11 (a value somewhere between 3.07 and 3.15) will be statistically significant. Our \(F\) = 13.566, so we have clearly exceeded the threshold. This is our \emph{omnibus F test}.

We can also use a look-up function, which follows this general form: qf(p, df1, df2. lower.tail=FALSE)

Significance at this level lets us know that there is at least 1 statistically significant difference between our control, low, and high racially loaded conditions. While it is important to follow-up to see where these significant differences lie, we will not do these by hand. Rather, let's rework the problem in R.

\hypertarget{working-the-one-way-anova-in-r}{%

\subsection{Evaluating the Statistical Assumptions}\label{evaluating-the-statistical-assumptions}}

All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. The one-way ANOVA has four assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dependent variable is normally distributed for each of the populations as defined by the different levels of the factor. We will examine this by

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    evaluating skew and kurtosis
  \item
    visually inspecting the distribution
  \item
    conduct a Shapiro Wilks test
  \item
    examine a QQ plot
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The variances of the dependent variable are the same for all populations. This is often termed the \emph{homogeneity of variance} assumption. We will examine this with

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Levene's Test
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The cases represent \emph{random} samples from the populations and scores on the test variable are \emph{independent} of each other. That is, comparing related cases (e.g., parent/child, manager/employee, time1/time2) violates this assumption and this question would need to be evaluated by a different statistic such as repeated measures ANOVA or dyadic data analysis.

  \begin{itemize}

From the \emph{psych} package, the \emph{describe()} function can be used to provide descriptive statistics (or, ``descriptives'') of continuously scaled variables (i.e., variables measured on the interval or ratio scale). In this simple example, we can specify the specific continuous, DV.

If we want descriptives for each level of the grouping variable (factor), we can use the \emph{describeBy()} function of the \emph{psych} package. The order of entry within the script is the DV followed by the grouping variable (IV).

Skew and kurtosis speaks to normal distributions. The skew and kurtosis indices in the \emph{psych} package are reported as \emph{z} scores. Regarding skew, values greater than 3.0 are generally considered ``severely skewed.'' Regarding kurtosis, ``severely kurtotic'' is argued to be anywhere greater 8 to 20 \citep{kline_principles_2016}.

The \emph{Shapiro-Wilks} test evaluates the hypothesis that the distribution of the data as a whole deviates from a comparable normal distribution. If the test is non-significant (\emph{p} \textgreater.05) the distribution of the sample is not significantly different from a normal distribution. If, however, the test is significant (\emph{p} \textless{} .05) then the sample distribution is significantly different from a normal distribution. The \emph{rstatix} package has a wrapper that can conduct the Shapiro-Wilks test for us.

\end{verbatim}

The \(p\) values for the distributions of the dependent variable (accurate) in each of the three conditions are all well above .05. This tells us that the Accurate variable does not deviate from a statistically significant distribution (Control, \emph{W} = 0.954, \emph{p} = 0.215; Low, \emph{W} = 0.944, \emph{p} = 0.115; High, \emph{W} = 0.980, \emph{p} = 0.831).

There are limitations to the Shapiro-Wilks test. As the dataset being evaluated gets larger, the Shapiro-Wilks test becomes more sensitive to small deviations; this leads to a greater probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (null hypothesis being the values come from a normal distribution). Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2014} advised that ANOVA is relatively robust to violations of normality if there are at least 15 cases per cell and the design is reasonably balanced (i.e., equal cell sizes).

\subsubsection{Are the variances of the dependent variable similar across the levels of the grouping factor?}\label{are-the-variances-of-the-dependent-variable-similar-across-the-levels-of-the-grouping-factor}}

The Levene's test evaluates the ANOVA assumption that variances of the dependent variable for each level of the independent variable are similarly distributed. We want this to be non-significant (\(p\) \textgreater{} .05). If violated, we need to use an ANOVA test that is ``robust to the violation of the homogeneity of variance'' (e.g., Welch's oneway).

In R, Levene's test is found in the \emph{car} package.

We write the result of the Levene's as \(F\)(2,87) = 1.532, \(p\) = 0.222. Because \(p\) \textgreater{} .05, we know that the result is nonsignficant -- that the variances of the three groups are not statistically significantly different than each other.

If the results had been statistically significantly different, we would have needed to use a Welch's \(F\) or robust version of ANOVA.

\hypertarget{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Summarizing results from the analysis of assumptions}\label{summarizing-results-from-the-analysis-of-assumptions}}

It is common for an APA style results section to begin with a review of the evaluation of the statistical assumptions. As we have just finished these analyses, I will document what we have learned so far:

A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the relationship between degree of racial loading of an exceptionalizing microaggression and the perceived accuracy of a research confederate's impression of the Asian or Asian American participant. The independent variable, condition, included three levels: control/none, low, and high levels of racial loading. Results of Levene's homogeneity of variance test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption (\(F\){[}2,87{]} = 1.532, \(p\) = 0.222). Similarly, results of the Shapiro Wilk's test indicated no violation of the normality assumption in each of the cells (control, \emph{W} = 0.954, \emph{p} = 0.215; low, \emph{W} = 0.944, \emph{p} = 0.115; high, \emph{W} = 0.980, \emph{p} = 0.831).

Now we can move onto computing the omnibus ANOVA. \emph{Omnibus} is the term applied to the first \emph{F} test that evaluates if all groups have the same mean \citep{chen_relationship_2018}. If this test is not significant there is no evidence in the data to reject the null; that is, there is no evidence to suggest that group means are different. If it is significant -- and there are three or more groups -- follow-up testing will be needed to determine where the differences lie.

\hypertarget{computing-the-omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Computing the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{computing-the-omnibus-anova}}

Having met all the assumptions, we are now ready to calculate the omnibus \(F\) test.

\caption{An image of the workflow for one-way ANOVA, showing that we are at the stage of computing the omnibus ANOVA.}
\end{figure}

ANOVA is a special case of the general linear model (regression is a ``not so special case'' of the general linear model), therefore we use the linear model function, \emph{aov()} to run the analysis.

In the code below, we predict Accuracy from COND (3 levels: control, low, high).

By assigning the results of the \emph{aov()} function to an object (omnibus) we can then use that object (think \emph{model}) in other functions to get details about our analysis.

Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
\end{verbatim}

Inserting the \emph{aov()} object (omnibus) into the summary command produces the ANOVA Source Table that we manually created above.

The values we see map onto those we calculated by hand. Our \(SS_M\) (9.432) plus \(SS_R\) (30.246) sum to equal the \(SS_T\) (39.678).

Dividing the two sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom produces the means squared.

Then, dividing the \(MS_M\) (COND) by \(MS_R\) (4.716/0.348) provides the \emph{F} ratio. By using a table of \emph{F} critical values, we already knew that our \emph{F} value exceeded the value in the table of critical values. Here we see that \emph{p} = 0.000.

The ``\emph{F} string'' for an APA style results section should be written like this: \emph{F} (2, 87) = 13.566, \emph{p} \textless{} .001.

The object we created with the \emph{aov()} function is capable of producing much information. Applying the \emph{names()} function to the object can give us a list of values within it.

\hypertarget{effect-size-for-the-one-way-anova}{%
\subsubsection{Effect size for the one-way ANOVA}\label{effect-size-for-the-one-way-anova}}

\textbf{Eta squared} is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the dependent variable/outcome that can be explained in terms of the independent variable/predictor. Traditional interpretive values are similar to the Pearson's \emph{r}:

0 = no relationship
.02 = small
.13 = medium
.26 = large
1 = a perfect (one-to-one) correspondence

A useful summary of effect sizes, guide to interpreting their magnitudes, and common usage can be found \href{https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/effectSize}{here} \citep{watson_rules_2020}.

The formula for \(\eta^2\) is straightforward. If we think back to our hand-calculations of all the sums of squares, we can see that this is the proportion of variance that is accounted for by the model.

\[\eta ^{2}=\frac{SS_{M}}{SS_{T}}\]
Hand calculation, then, is straightforward.:

Notice that there are two effect sizes. We described eta-squared. Partial eta-squared is the default effect size reported in SPSS. There is a long history of debate about which to use. In certain circumstances (especially in more complicated analyses), partial-eta squared can be a bit more generous (i.e., larger than \(\eta^2\)). Thus, many prefer the reporting of the more cautious \(\eta^2\).

In our case, we see no difference between the two values. Differences begin to appear in datasets that are more complicated, such as when sample sizes across the levels of a factor differ.

Presenting the APA style results of the omnibus test is very straightforward:

\hypertarget{follow-up-to-the-omnibus-f}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Follow-up to the Omnibus \emph{F}}{Follow-up to the Omnibus F}}\label{follow-up-to-the-omnibus-f}}

The \emph{F}-test associated with the one-way ANOVA is the \emph{omnibus} -- giving the result for the overall test. Looking at the workflow for the one-way ANOVA we see that if we had had we had a non-significant \(F\), we would have stopped our analysis.

However, if the omnibus \(F\) is significant, we know that there is at least one pair of cells where there is a statistically significant difference. We have several ways (each with its own strengths/limitations) to figure out where these differences lie.

A very common option is to conduct post-hoc, pairwise comparisons.

The output only provides the \(p\) values associated with the mean differences in each of the conditions. We see that \(p < .05\) when high is compared to control (0.00015) and high is compared to low (0.0000042). An APA style reporting results of these typically involves referencing the means (often reported in a table of means and standard deviations) or mean differences (hand calculated) with their \emph{p} values.

\textbf{Should we be concerned about Type I error?{}``}

Recall that \emph{Type I error} is the concern about false positives -- that we would incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis (that we would say that there is a statistically significant difference when there is not one). This concern increases when we have a large number of pairwise comparisons.

Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2014} reviewed three options for managing Type I error.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditional Bonferroni:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Adjusts the \emph{p} value upward by multiplying it (the raw \emph{p} values) by the number of comparisons being completed. This holds the \emph{total} Type I error rate across these tests to \(\alpha\) (usually .05). The traditional Bonferroni is simple and therefore attractive, but when \emph{p} values hover around .05, it can be too restrictive.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Holms Sequential Bonferroni:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We'll describe this in more detail later. Briefly, it allows us to rank order the comparisons by their \emph{p} value (smallest to largest). We determine the significance of each \emph{p} value \emph{sequentially} where the criteria for significance is incrementally relaxed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  LSD method:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Permitted when there are only three pairwise comparisons among three groups, researchers can leave the \emph{p} values as they are. Since the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} research vignette is one of those circumstances, I not make adjustments for Type I error. That is, I would claim the LSD and cite Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2014} as justification for that decision.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There is, though, an even more powerful approach\ldots{}

\hypertarget{option-2-planned-contrasts-non-orthogonal}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION 2: Planned contrasts (non-orthogonal)}\label{option-2-planned-contrasts-non-orthogonal}}

Another option is to evaluate planned comparisons.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway/OnewayWrkFlw_planned.jpg}
\caption{An image of the workflow for one-way ANOVA, showing that we are at the following up to a significant omnibus F by conducting planned comparisons}
\end{figure}

Planned comparisons are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  theory-driven comparisons constructed prior to data collection,
\item
  based on the idea of partitioning the variance created by the overall effect of group differences into gradually smaller portions of variance, and
\item
  more powerful than post-hoc tests.
\end{itemize}

Planned contrasts involve further considerations regarding the \emph{partitioning of variance.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There will always be \emph{k}-1 contrasts.
\item
  Each contrast must involve only two chunks of variance.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Orthogonal} contrasts are even more sophisticated. Essential to conducting an orthogonal contrast is the requirement that if a group is singled out in one comparison it should be excluded from subsequent contrasts. The typical, orthogonal scenario with three ordered groups has only two contrasts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Control versus low and high (because control was excluded, it should not reappear in the next contrast)
\item
  Low versus high
\end{enumerate}

Underlying the \emph{aov()} program is the linear model (``lm''). We could have used it to calculate the omnibus ANOVA, but it has clunky output.

We use it now to retrieve some contrast information. The code below is a planned comparison that uses the coding in the database (created when we formatted COND as an ordered factor) to compare the lowest coded group (control was 1, low was 2, high was 3) to the other two groups.

Note that these tests are conducted as \emph{t} tests. Why? We are comparing only two groups and can use the \emph{t}. distribution.

Also note that these involved the comparison of the control group to low; then the control to high. This is consistent with an orthogonal contrast in that there are \emph{k} - 1 contrasts (two contrasts with three original groups). However it is inconsistent with the requriement that once a group is singled out, it should not be used in a subsequent contrast. Therefore, it is quite possible we want something different.

\hypertarget{option-3-planned-contrasts-orthogonal}{%
\subsubsection{OPTION 3: Planned contrasts (orthogonal)}\label{option-3-planned-contrasts-orthogonal}}

\textbf{Step 1: } Specify our contrasts

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Specifying the contrasts means you know their order within the factor
\item
  Early in the data preparation, we created an ordered factor with Control, Low, High as the order.
\item
  We want orthogonal contrasts, this means there will be

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{k} - 1 contrasts; with three groups we will have two contrasts
  \item
    once we single out a condition for comparison, we cannot use it again.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In \emph{contrast1} we compare the control condition to the combined low and high conditions.
In \emph{contrast2} we discard the control condition (it was already singled out) and we compare the low and high conditions.

This is sensible because we likely hypothesize that any degree of racially loaded stereotypes may have a deleterious outcome, so we first compare control to the two conditions with any degree of racial loading. Subsequently, we compare the low and high levels of the factor.

\textbf{Step 2:} Bind them together and check the output to ensure that we've mapped them correctly.

Polynomial contrasts evaluate for the presence of a linear (or curvilinear) pattern in the data. To detect a trend, the data must be coded in an ascending order and it needs to be a sensible, theoretically defensible, comparison. Our data has a theoretically ordered effect (control, low racially loaded condition, high racially loaded condition). Recall that we created an ordered factor when we imported the data.

In a polynomial analysis, the statistical analysis looks across the ordered means to see if they fit a linear or curvilinear shape that is one less than the number of levels. Our factor has three levels, therefore the polynomial contrast can check for a linear shape (.L) or a quadratic (one change in direction) shape (.Q). If we had four levels, the contr.poly could check for cubic change (two changes in direction). Conventionally, when more than one trend is significant, we intepret the most complex one (i.e., quadratic over linear).

A quick peek back at an early plot shows illustrates the quadratic trend that was supported by the analysis.

Results of our polynomial contrast suggested statistically significant results for both linear \(t(87) = -3.963 , p < .001\) and quadratic \(t(87) = -3.380, p = .001\) trends.

\hypertarget{which-set-of-follow-up-tests-do-we-report}{%
\subsubsection{Which set of follow-up tests do we report?}\label{which-set-of-follow-up-tests-do-we-report}}

It depends! What best tells the story of your data? Here are some things to consider.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the post-hoc comparisons are robustly statistically significant (and controlling Type I error is not going to change that significance), I think this provides good information and I would learn toward reporting those.
\item
  If \emph{p} values are hovering around 0.05, an orthogonal contrast will offer more power because

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a \emph{k} - 1 comparison will be more powerful
  \item
    a priori theory is compelling
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The polynomial can be a useful descriptive addition if there is a linear or quadratic relationship that is sensible or interesting.
\end{itemize}

Although I would report either the post-hoc or planned contrasts, I will sometimes add a polynomial if it clarifies the result (i.e., there is a meaningful linear or curvilinear pattern essential to understanding the data.

\hypertarget{what-if-we-violated-the-homogeneity-of-variance-test}{%
\subsection{What if we Violated the Homogeneity of Variance test?}\label{what-if-we-violated-the-homogeneity-of-variance-test}}

The \emph{oneway.test} produces Welch's \emph{F} -- a test more robust to violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption. The Welch's approach to attenuating error or erroneous conclusions caused by violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption is to adjust the residual degrees of freedom used to produce the Welch's \emph{F}-ratio.

Another common correction is the Brown and Forsythe \emph{F}-ratio. At this time I have not located and tried an R package that produces this.

\end{verbatim}

Note that the denominator \emph{df} is now 56.34 (not 87) and \emph{p} value is a little larger (it was 0.00000745). With its design intended to avoid making a Type I error, the Welch's \emph{F} is more ``conservative.'' While it doesn't matter in this case, if it were a study where the \emph{p} value was closer to .05, it could make a difference. These are some of the tradeoffs made in order to have confidence in the results.

\hypertarget{power-analysis}{%
\section{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis}}

Power analysis allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Utilized another way, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. If the probability is unacceptably low, we may want to revise or stop. A helpful overview of power as well as guidelines for how to use the \emph{pwr} package can be found at a \href{https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{Quick-R website} \citep{kabacoff_power_2017}.

There are four interrelating elements of power:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample size, \emph{N}
\item
  Effect size,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For one-way ANOVAs, Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Significance level = P(Type I error),

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recall that Type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis (a false positive).
  \item
    Stated another way, Type I error is the probability of finding an effect that is not there.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  power = 1 - P(Type II error),

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recall that Type II error is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis (a false negative).
  \item
    Power is the probability of finding an effect that is there.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If we have any three of these values, we can calculate the fourth.

In Champely's \emph{pwr} package, we can conduct a power analysis for a variety of designs, including the balanced one-way ANOVA (i.e., roughly equal cell sizes) design that we worked in this chapter.

The \emph{pwr.anova.test()} has five parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{k} = \# groups
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size
\item
  \emph{f} = effect sizes, where 0.1/small, 0.25/medium, and 0.4/large

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the absence from an estimate from our own data, we make a guess about the expected effect size value based on our knowledge of the literature
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{sig.level} = \emph{p} value that you will use
\item
  \emph{power} = .80 is the standard value
\end{itemize}

In the script below, we simply add our values. So long as we have four values, the fifth will be calculated for us.

Because this calculator requires the effect size in the metric of Cohen's \emph{f} (this is not the same as the \emph{F} ratio), we need to convert it. The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function.

All that's left to do is \emph{write it up}! APA style results sections in empirical manuscripts are typically accompanied by tables and figures. APA style discourages repeated material and encourages reducing the cognitive load of the reader. For this example, I suggest two tables -- one with means and standard deviations of the groups and a second that reports the output from the one-way ANOVA. In an article with multiple statistics, the authors might wish to combine or delete these.

The package \emph{apaTables} can produce journal-ready tables by using the object produced by the \emph{aov()} function. Deciding what to report in text and table is important.

With table and figure at hand, here is how I would write up these results:

A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the relationship between degree of racial loading of an exceptionalizing microaggression and the perceived accuracy of a research confederate's impression of the Asian or Asian American participant. The independent variable, COND, included three levels: control/none, low, and high levels of racial loading. Results of Levene's homogeneity of variance test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption (\(F\){[}2,87{]} = 1.532, \(p\) = 0.222). Similarly, results of the Shapiro Wilk's test indicated no violation of the normality assumption in each of the cells (Control, \emph{W} = 0.954, \emph{p} = 0.215; Low, \emph{W} = 0.944, \emph{p} = 0.115; High, \emph{W} = 0.980, \emph{p} = 0.831).

Results indicated a significant effect of COND on accuracy perception \emph{F} (2, 87) = 13.566, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2\) = 0.238. In a series of post-hoc comparisons, there were statistically significant differences between the control and high (\(M_{diff}\) = 0.61, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and low and high (\(M_{diff}\) = 0.75, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) conditions, but not the control and low conditions (\(M_{diff}\) = -.14, \emph{p} = 0.347). A statistically significant polynomial contrast suggested a quadratic trend across the three, ordered, levels of the conditions (\(t[87] = -0.364, p = .001\)) such that perception of accuracy increased slighty from the control to low conditions, but decreased more dramatically from low to high. Consequently, it appeared that only the highest degree of racial loading (e.g., ``You speak English well for an Asian'') resulted in the decreased perceptions of accuracy of impressions from the confederate. Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1 and complete ANOVA results are presented in Table 2. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the results.

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-1}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that offer differing levels of difficulty. Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  testing the statistical assumptions
\item
  conducting a one-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    follow-up (pairwise, planned comparisons, polynomial trends)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  writing a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.}}

If one-way ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(2021)'' from 2021 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.

There are other ways to change the dataset. For example, if you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller. If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.

In their study, Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} included an outcome variable where participants rated how much longer they would continue the interaction with their partner compared to their interactions in general. The scale ranged from -2 (\emph{much less than average}) through 0 (\emph{average}) to 2 (\emph{much more than average}). This variable is available in the original simulation and is an option for a slightly more challenging analysis.

Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g., IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from an open science repository; data from other chapters in this OER), complete a one-way ANOVA. Please have at least 3 levels for the predictor variable.

I'm still learning about this and am using the lessons to practice. In these hidden (from the rendered view) boxes of script, I am capturing the output values as R objects. Later I can use inline code (the object's name, preceded with an ``r'', surrounded by tics {[}unfortunately, I cannot demo it in the .rmd file without getting an error{]}) to insert the value into the lecture notes and results. I'm working up to writing an entire journal article in R. This way, if something changes (e.g., more participants in the Qualtrics survey, a different approach to cleaning data) when I re-run the script everything auto-updates and I'm at less of a risk (or maybe a different kind of risk) for making typographical errors.

\href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=3bb1bee1-c2ac-4cda-95f2-ad8b0152132c}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

In this (somewhat long and complex) lesson we conduct a 3X2 ANOVA. We will

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Work an actual example from the literature.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``by hand'', and
  \item
    with R packages
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I will also demonstrate

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    several options for exploring interaction effects, and
  \item
    several options for exploring main effects.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Exploring these options will allow us to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Gain familiarity with the concepts central to multi-factor ANOVAs.
  \item
    Explore tools for analyzing the complexity in designs.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The complexity is that not all of these things need to be conducted for every analysis. The Two-Way ANOVA Workflow is provided to help you map a way through your own analyses. I will periodically refer to this map so that we can more easily keep track of where we are in the process.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-3}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-3}}

There is about 1 hour and 30 minutes hours of lecture. If you work through the materials with me plan for another two hours of study.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-3}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-3}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define, locate, and interpret all the effects associated with two-way ANOVA:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    main
  \item
    interaction (introducing the concept, \emph{moderator})
  \item
    simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Identify which means belong with which effects. Then compare and interpret them.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    marginal means
  \item
    individual cell means
  \item
    comparing them
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Map a process/workflow for investigating a factorial ANOVA
\item
  Manage Type I error
\item
  Conduct a power analysis to determine sample size
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-2}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-2}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} article has two dependent variables (DVs; negative and positive evaluation) which are suitable for two-way ANOVAs. I will demonstrate a simulation of one of their 3X2 ANOVAs (negative) in this lecturette. The second dependent variable (positive) is suggested for the moderate level of difficulty.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introducing-factorial-anova}{%
\section{Introducing Factorial ANOVA}\label{introducing-factorial-anova}}

My approach to teaching is to address the conceptual as we work problems. That said, there are some critical ideas we should address first.

\textbf{ANOVA is for experiments} (or arguably closely related designs). As we get into the assumptions you'll see that it has some rather restrictive ones (e.g., there should be an equal/equivalent number of cases per cell). To the degree that we violate these assumptions, we should locate alternative statistical approaches where these assumptions are relaxed.

\textbf{Factorial}: a term used when there are two or more independent variables (IVs; the factors). The factors could be between-groups, within-groups, repeated measures, or a combination of between and within.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Independent factorial design}: several IVs (predictors/factors) and each has been measured using different participants (between groups).
\item
  \textbf{Related factorial design}: several IVs (factors/predictors) have been measured, but the same participants have been used in all conditions (repeated measures or within-subjects).
\item
  \textbf{Mixed design}: several IVs (factors/predictors) have been measured. One or more factors uses different participants (between-subjects) and one or more factors uses the same participants (within-subjects). Thus, there is a cobination of independent (between) and related (within or repated) designs.
\item
  Factor naming follows a number/levels convention.\\
\item
  Today's example is a 3X2 ANOVA. We know there are two factors that have three and two levels, respectively: \emph{ethnicity} has three levels representing the two ethnic groups that were in prior conflict (Marudese, Dayaknese) and a third group who was uninvolved in the conflict (Javanese); \emph{photo stimulus} has two levels representing members of the two ethnic groups that were in prior conflict (Madurese, Dayaknese);
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Moderator} is what creates an interaction. Below are traditional representations of the \emph{statistical} and \emph{conceptual} figures of interaction effects. We will say that Factor B, \emph{moderates} the relationship between Factor A/IV and the DV.

In a later lesson we work an ANCOVA -- where we will distinguish between a \emph{moderator} and a \emph{covariate.} In regression models, you will likely be introduced to the \emph{mediator.}

  Enter data

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    predictors should formatted as as factors (ordered or unordered); the dependent variable should be continuously scaled

  \tightlist
  \item
    graphing the data
  \item
    computing descriptive statistics
  \item
    check distributional assumptions
  \item
    use Levene's test to check for homogeneity of variance
  \item
    use Shapiro Wilks to check for normality
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Construct or choose contrasts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    select contrasts and specify for all of the IVs in the analysis
  \item
    if you want to use Type III sums of squares, contrasts must be orthogonal
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Compute the omnibus ANOVA

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{depending on what you found in the data exploration phase, you may need to run a robust version of the test}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Follow-up testing based on significant main or interaction effects

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    significant interactions require test of simple main effects which could be further explored with contrasts, posthoc comparisons, and/or polynomials
  \item
    \emph{the exact methods you choose will depend upon the tests of assumptions during data exploration}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Managing Type I error

\hypertarget{research-vignette-2}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-2}}

The research vignette for this example was located in Kalimantan, Indonesia and focused on bias in young people from three ethnic groups. The Madurese and Dayaknese groups were engaged in ethnic conflict that spanned 1996 to 2001. The last incidence of mass violence was in 2001 where approximately 500 people (mostly from the Madurese ethnic group) were expelled from the province. Ramdhani et al.'s \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} research hypotheses were based on the roles of the three ethnic groups in the study. The Madurese appear to be viewed as the transgressors when they occupied lands and took employment and business opportunities from the Dayaknese. Ramdhani et al.~also included a third group who were not involved in the conflict (Javanese). The research participants were students studying in Yogyakara who were not involved in the conflict. They included 39 Madurese, 35 Dyaknese, and 37 Javanese; 83 were male and 28 were female.

In the study \citep{ramdhani_affective_2018}, participants viewed facial pictures of three men and three women (in traditional dress) from each ethnic group (6 photos per ethnic group). Participant were asked, ``How do you feel when you see this photo? Please indicate your answers based on your actual feelings.'' Participants responded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicated ratings of higher intensity on that scale. The two scales included the following words:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Positive: friendly, kind, helpful, happy
\item
  Negative: disgusting, suspicious, hateful, angry
\end{itemize}

Below is script to simulate data for the negative reactions variable from the information available from the manuscript \citep{ramdhani_affective_2018}.

\hypertarget{working-the-factorial-anova-by-hand}{%
\section{Working the Factorial ANOVA (by hand)}\label{working-the-factorial-anova-by-hand}}

Before we work an ANOVA let's take a moment to consider what we are doing and how it informs our decision-making. This figure (which already contains ``the answers'') may help conceptualize how variance becomes partitioned.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/partition.png}
\caption{Image of a flowchart that partitions variance from sums of squares totals to its component pieces}
\end{figure}

As in one-way ANOVA, we partition variance into \textbf{total}, \textbf{model}, and \textbf{residual}. However, we now further divide the \(SS_M\) into its respective factors A(column), B(row,) and their a x b product.

In this, we begin to talk about main effects and interactions.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-total-1}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Total}\label{sums-of-squares-total-1}}

Our formula is the same as it was for one-way ANOVA:

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]
Let's calculate it for the Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} data.
Our grand (i.e., overall) mean is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(Ramdhani\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Negative)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2.947369
\end{verbatim}

Subtracting the grand mean from each Negative rating yields a mean difference.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\NormalTok{Ramdhani\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ Ramdhani\_df }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{m\_dev =}\NormalTok{ Negative}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(Negative))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Pop quiz: What's the sum of our new \emph{m\_dev} variable?

Let's find out!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(Ramdhani\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{m\_dev)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -0.000000000000007549517
\end{verbatim}

Of course! The sum of squared deviations around the mean is zero. Next we square those mean deviations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Ramdhani\_df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ Ramdhani\_df }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{m\_devSQ =}\NormalTok{ m\_dev}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then we sum the squared mean deviations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(Ramdhani\_df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{m\_devSQ)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 114.7746
\end{verbatim}

This value, 114.775, the sum of squared deviations around the grand mean, is our \(SS_T\); the associated \emph{degrees of freedom} is \(N\) - 1.

In factorial ANOVA, we divide \(SS_T\) into \textbf{model/between} sums of squares and \textbf{residual/within} sums of squares.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-for-the-model}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares for the Model}\label{sums-of-squares-for-the-model}}

\[SS_{M}= \sum n_{k}(\bar{x}_{k}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]

The \emph{model} generally represents the notion that the means are different than each other. We want the variation between our means to be greater than the variation within each of the groups from which our means are calculated.

In factorial, we need to obtain means for each of the combinations of the factors. We have a 3 x 2:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rater with three levels: Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese
\item
  Photo with two levels: Dayaknese, Madurese

This value, 35.415, \(SS_M\) is the value accounted for by the model. That is, the amount of variance accounted for by the grouping variable/factors, Rater and Photo.

\hypertarget{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within-1}{%
\subsection{Sums of Squares Residual (or within)}\label{sums-of-squares-residual-or-within-1}}

\(SS_R\) is error associated with within group variability. If people are randomly assigned to treatment group there should be no other covariate (confounding variable) so that all \(SS_R\) variability is \emph{uninteresting} for the research and treated as noise.

\[SS_{R}= \sum(x_{ik}-\bar{x}_{k})^{^{2}}\]
Here's another configuration of the same:

\[SS_{R}= s_{group1}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group2}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group3}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group4}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group5}^{2}(n-1) + s_{group6}^{2}(n-1))\]

Again, the formula is in six chunks -- but this time the calculations are \emph{within-group}. We need the variance (the standard deviation squared) for the calculation. Let's take another look at our descriptives.

What have we learned?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there is a main effect for Rater
\item
  there is a main effect for Photo
\item
  there is a significant interaction effect
\end{itemize}

In the face of this significant interaction effect, we would follow-up by investigating the interaction effect. Why? The significant interaction effect means that findings (e.g., the story of the results) are more complex than group identity or photo stimulus, alone, can explain.

All statistical tests have some assumptions about the data. This particular ANOVA has four:

Assumptions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cases represent random samples from the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is an issue of research design
  \item
    Although we see ANOVA used (often incorrectly) in other settings, ANOVA was really designed for the random clinical trial (RCT).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Scores on the DV are independent of each other.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With correlated observations, there is a dramatic increase of Type I error
  \item
    There are options designed for analyzing data that has dependencies (e.g., repeated measures ANOVA, dyadic data analysis, multilevel modeling)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The DV is normally distributed for each of the populations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    that is, data for each cell (representing the combinations of each factor) is normally distributed
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Population variances of the DV are the same for all cells

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When cell sizes are not equal, ANOVA not robust to this violation and cannot trust F ratio
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Even though we position the evaluation of assumptions first -- some of the best tests of the assumptions use the resulting ANOVA model. Because of this, I will quickly run the model now. I will not explain the results until after we evaluate the assumptions.

I have marked our Two-Way ANOVA Workflow with a yellow box outlined in red to let us know that we are just beginning the process of analyzing our data.

Using guidelines from Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} our values for skewness should fall below 3.0 (they do) and all values for kurtosis should fall below 8 to 20 (ours do).

In a factorial design, the Shapiro-Wilk test is applied to residuals from the model itself. Examination of those residuals can give us a good indication of normality.

First, we extract the residuals (i.e., that which is left-over/unexplained) from the model. We can examine their distribution with a plot.

Here's how I would summarize our data in terms of normality:

Factorial ANOVA assumes that the dependent variable is normally is distributed for all cells in the design. Our analysis suggested skew and kurtosis were within the bounds considered to be normally distributed. Further, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) suggested that the plotting of the residuals did not differ significantly from a normal distribution (\(W\) = 0.9846, \(p\) = 0.234).

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-variance}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of variance}\label{homogeneity-of-variance}}

We can evaluate the homogeneity of variance test with the Levene's test for the equality of error variances. Levene's requires a \emph{fully saturated model.} This means that the prediction model requires an interaction effect (not just two, non-interacting predictors). We can use the \emph{leveneTest()} function from the \emph{car} package. Within the function we specify the model we will be testing in the factorial ANOVA. That is, predicting Negative from the Rater and Photo factors. The asterisk indicates that they will also be added as an interaction term.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Evaluating the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{evaluating-the-omnibus-anova}}

The \emph{F}-tests associated with the two-way ANOVA are the \emph{omnibus} -- providing the result for the main and interaction effects.

Here's where we are in the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_Omnibus.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

When we run the two-way ANOVA we will be looking for several effects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main effects for each predictor, and
\item
  the interaction effect.
\end{itemize}

It is possible that all effects will be significant, none will be significant, or some will be significant. The interaction effect always takes precedence over the main effect because it let's us know there is a more nuanced/complex story.

In specifying the ANOVA, order of entry matters. If you have a distinction between IV and moderator, put the IV first.

\textbf{Eta squared} is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the DV/outcome variable that can be explained in terms of the IVs/predictors. Traditional interpretive values are similar to the Pearson's \emph{r}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  0 = no relationship
\item
  .02 = small
\item
  .13 = medium
\item
  .26 = large
\item
  1.0 = a perfect (one-to-one) correspondence
\end{itemize}

The formula for \(\eta ^{2}\) is straightforward:

\[\eta ^{2}=\frac{SS_{M}}{SS_{T}}\]
We can apply the \emph{etaSquared()} function from the \emph{lsr} package to our ANOVA object to retrieve \$\eta \^{}\{2\}.

Before moving to follow-up, let's capture an APA style write-up so far.

\hypertarget{apa-write-up-of-the-omnibus-results}{%
\subsubsection{APA Write-up of the omnibus results}\label{apa-write-up-of-the-omnibus-results}}

A 3 X 2 ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the effects of rater ethnicity (3 levels, Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese) and photo stimulus (2 levels, Dayaknese on Madurese,) on negative reactions to the photo stimuli. Results of Levene's Test for Equality of Error Variances indicated violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption, (\(F\){[}5, 105{]} = 8.834, \(p\) \textless{} .001). Our analysis of the individual cell means (see Table 1 for means and standard deviations) suggested skew and kurtosis were within the bounds considered to be normally distributed \citep{kline_principles_2016}. A non-significant Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) provided further evidence that the assumption of normality was not violated (\(W\) = 0.9846, \(p\) = 0.234).

Computing sums of squares with a Type II approach, the results for the ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for ethnicity of the rater (\emph{F}{[}2, 105{]} = 8.077, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.107), a significant main effect for photo stimulus, (\emph{F}{[}1, 105{]} = 19.346, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.127), and a significant interaction effect (\emph{F}{[}2, 105{]} = 5.696, \emph{p} = .004, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.075).

\emph{Note. The next paragraph will have one of the follow-up options. We will add it later in the lesson}

\hypertarget{follow-up-a-significant-interaction-effect}{%
\subsection{Follow-up a significant interaction effect}\label{follow-up-a-significant-interaction-effect}}

In factorial ANOVA we are interested in main effects and interaction effects. When the result is explained by a main effect, then there is a consistent trend as a function of a factor (e.g., Madurese raters had consistently higher Negative evaluations, irrespective of stimulus). In an interaction effect, the results are more complex (e.g., the ratings across the stimulus differed for the three groups of raters).

There are a variety of strategies to follow-up a significant interaction effect. I will demonstrate the four I believe to be the most useful in the context of psychologists operating within the scientist-practitioner-advocacy context.

When an interaction effect is significant (irrespective of the significance of one or more main effects), examination of \textbf{simple main effects} is a common statistical/explanatory approached that is used. The Two-Way ANOVA Workflow shows where we are in this process.

If I were using this approach in a 3 X 2 ANOVA, I would probably not control for Type I error. Why? I only conducted follow-up comparisons to evaluate the simple main effect of photo stimulus within rater ethnicity; that is, I would hold it at alpha = 0.05.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Photo stimulus (Dayaknese or Madurese) within the Dayaknese ethnic group.
\item
  Photo stimulus (Dayaknese or Madurese) within the Madurese ethnic group.
\item
  Photo stimulus (Dayaknese or Madurese) within the Javanese ethnic group.
\end{itemize}

However, because it is good for instruction, it would be equally fine to use a traditional Bonferroni, dividing .05/3 = 0.017 and testing each at 0.017. I will use this approach in the write-up.

FAQ: Could we do the reverse simple effect, ethnicity of rater within the photo stimulus? Absolutely! The choice is yours (and sometimes the results will differ). I usually run both and then report ONE -- the one that conveys the story the data has to tell. You \emph{could} report both sets, but then you would really want to control Type I error and your repetitive contrasts are far from independent/orthogonal.

\textbf{APA Style Results for Option \#1 follow-up.} \emph{This would be added to the results of the omnibus two-way ANOVA.}

\emph{Option \#1}: To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within the ethnicity of the rater. That is, we looked at the effect of the photo stimulus within the Dayaknese, Madurese, and Javanese groups, separately. To control for Type I error across the three simple main effects, we set alpha at .017 (.05/3). Results indicated significant differences for Dayaknese (\emph{F} {[}1, 33{]} = 50.4, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.60.) and Javanese ethnic groups (\emph{F} {[}1, 35{]}= 17.18, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.33), but not for the Madurese ethnic group (\emph{F} {[}1, 37{]} = 0.000, \emph{p} = .993, \(\eta ^{2}\) \textless{} .001). As illustrated in Figure 1, the Dayaknese and Javanese rathers both reported stronger negative reactions to the Madurese. The differences in ratings for the Madurese were not statistically significantly different. In this way, the rater's ethnic group moderated the relationship between the photo stimulus and negative reactions.

In this simple main effect of ethnicity of rater (3 levels) within photo stimulus (2 levels), we will conduct two one-way ANOVAs for the Dayaknese and Madurese photos, separately. However, we will want to do orthogonal contrast-coding for rater ethnicity for the follow-up (to the follow-up).

It helps to know what the default contrast codes are; we can get that information with the \emph{contrasts()} function.

Let's create custom contrasts. Recall that an orthogonal contrast requires that there be one less contrast than the number of groups and that once a group is singled out, it cannot be compared again.

Thus, I want to compare the

Here's a write-up of this portion of the result.

The simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within rating the photos of Madurese people was not statistically significant: (\emph{F} {[}2, 54{]} = 0.679, \emph{p} = .512, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.024). Correspondingly, follow-up testing indicated non-significant differences when the ratings of the Javanese were compared to Dayaknese and Madurese, combined (\emph{F} {[}1, 54{]} = 1.008, \emph{p} = .320) and when the ratings of the Dayaknese and Madurese were compared (\emph{F} {[}1, 54{]} = 0.349, \emph{p} = .557)

To control for Type I error, we have 4 follow-up contrasts (2 for Dayaknese, 2 for Madurese). We'll control Type I error with .05/4 = .0125

\textbf{APA Write-up of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within rater ethnicity.}

This would be added to the write-up of the omnibus two-way ANOVA test.

\emph{Option \#2}: To explore the interaction effect, we followed with tests of simple effect of rater ethnicity within the photo stimulus. That is, we looked at the effect of each each rater's ethnicity within the Madurese and Dayaknese photo stimulus, separately. Our first analysis evaluated the effect of the rater's ethnicity when evaluating the Dayaknese photo; our second analysis evaluated effect of the rater's ethnicity when evaluating the Madurese photo. To control for Type I error across the two simple main effects, we set alpha at .0125 (.05/4). The simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within the reaction to the photos of members of the Dayaknese ethnic group was statistically significant: \emph{F} {[}2, 51{]} = 13.32, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.343. Follow-up testing indicated non-significant differences when the ratings from members of the Javanese ethnic group were compared to the Dayaknese and Madurese, combined (\emph{F} {[}1, 51{]} = 0.095, \emph{p} = .759). There was a statistically significant difference when Dayaknese and Madurese raters were compared (\emph{F} {[}1, 51{]} =26.554, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). The simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within when rating the photos of Madurese people was not statistically significant: (\emph{F} {[}2, 54{]} = 0.679, \emph{p} = .512, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.024). Correspondingly, follow-up testing indicated non-significant differences when the ratings of the Javanese were compared to Dayaknese and Madurese, combined (\emph{F} {[}1, 54{]} = 1.008, \emph{p} = .320) and when the ratings of the Dayaknese and Madurese were compared (\emph{F} {[}1, 54{]} = 0.349, \emph{p} = .557). This moderating effect of ethnicity of the rater on the negative reaction to the photo stimulus is illustrated in Figure 1.

As the numbers of levels increase, post hoc comparisons become somewhat unwieldly. Even though this procedure produces them all, you can select which sensible number you want to compare and control for Type I error according to the number in that set.

With rater ethnicity (3 levels) and photo stimulus (2 levels), we have 6 groupings. When \emph{k} is the number of groups, the total number of paired comparisons is: k(k-1)*2

If we want to consider all 15 pairwise comparisons and also control for Type I error, a Holm's sequential Bonerroni \citep{green_using_2014} will help us take a middle-of-the-road approach (not as strict as .05/15 with the traditional Bonferroni; not as lenient as ``none'') to managing Type I error.

With the Holms, we rank order the \emph{p} values associated with the 15 comparisons in order from lowest (e.g., .0000018) to highest (e.g., 1.000). The first \emph{p} value is evaluated with the most strict criterion (.05/15; the traditional Bonferonni approach). Then, each successive comparison calculates the \emph{p} value by using the number of \emph{remaining} comparisons as the denominator (e.g., .05/14, .05/13, .05/12). As the \emph{p} values rise and the alpha levels relax, there will be a cut-point where remaining comparisons are not statistically significant.

In Excel, I would sort my results by their \emph{p} values (low to high) and consider my threshold (\emph{p} \textless{} .0033) to determine which effects were statistically significant. Using the strictest criteria of \emph{p} \textless{} .0033, we would have four statistically significant values.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/Holmsequential.jpg}
\caption{Image of the results of the Holms sequential Bonferroni.}
\end{figure}

I would ask, ``Is this what we want?'' Similar to the simple main effects we just tested, I am interested in two sets of comparisons:

First, how are the two sets of photos (Madurese and Dayaknese) rated within each set of raters.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Javanese:Madurese - Javanese:Dayaknese
\item
  Dayaknese:Madurese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\item
  Madurese:Madurese - Madurese:Dayaknese
\end{itemize}

Second, focused on each photo, what are the relative ratings.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Javanese:Madurese - Dayaknese:Madurese
\item
  Madurese: Madurese - Dayaknese:Madurese
\item
  Javanese:Dayaknese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\item
  Madurese: Dayaknese - Dayaknese:Dayaknese
\end{itemize}

This is only seven sets of comparisons and would considerably reduce the alpha:

Below I have greyed-out the comparisons that are less interesting to me and left the seven that are my focal interest. I have highlighted in green the two comparisons that are statistically significant based on the Holms' sequential criteria. In this case, it does not make any difference in our interpretation of these focal predictors.

In the context of the significant interaction effect, we might also be interested in polynomial trends for any simple main effects where 3 or more cells are compared.

Why? If there are only two cells being compared, then the significance of that has already been tested and if significant, it is also a significant linear effect (because the shape between any two points is a line). Below is a figure of where the polynomial test of an interaction effect may fall in the process.

At the outset, let me acknowledge that this is not the best example to demonstrate a polynomial trend. Why? We do not necessarily have an ordered prediction across categories for this vignette. Other research scenarios (e.g., when dosage is none, low, high) are more readily suited for this approach.

In our example, Rater has three groups Thus, we could evaluate a polynomial for the simple main effect of ethnicity of the rater within photo stimulus (separately for the photos of the Dayaknese and Madurese). We conduct these separately for Dayaknese, Madurese, and Javanese groups.

In the event that more than one polynomial trend select the higher one. For example, if both linear and quadratic are selected, interpret the quadratic trend

\section{Investigating Main Effects}\label{investigating-main-effects}}

We now focus on the possibility that there might be significant main effects, but a non-significant interaction effect. We only interpret main effects when there is a non-significant interaction effect. Why? Because in the presence of a significant interaction effect, the main effect will not tell a complete story. \emph{(And, if we didn't specify a correct model, we still might have an incomplete story. But that's another issue.)} Here's where we are on the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WayWrkFlw_Main.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

Recall that main effects are the \emph{marginal means} -- that is the effects of Factor A \emph{collapsed across} all the levels of Factor B.

If the main effect has only two levels (e.g., the ratings of the Dayaknese and Madurese photos):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the comparison was already ignoring/including all levels of the rater ethnicity factor (Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese),
\item
  it was only a comparison of two cells (Dayaknese rater, Madurese rater), therefore
\item
  there is no need for further follow-up.
\end{itemize}

If the main effect has three or more levels (e.g,. ethnicity of rater with Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese levels), then you would follow-up with one or more of the myriad of options. In this class we have focused on three:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

I will demonstrate how to do each as follow-up to a \emph{pretend} scenario where a main effect (but not an interaction) had been significant. I will write up the portion that would be inserted in an APA style results section.

Essentially, we treat these main effect analyses as the follow-up to a significant one-way ANOVA evaluating, in our case, the ethnicity of the Rater.

An easy possibility is to follow-up with all possible post-hocs. In the main effect case, these are far simpler than where we conducted all possile posthocs for the interaction effect (remember the Holms sequential Bonferroni?).

Here is a reminder of our location on the workflow.

\hypertarget{follow-up-with-planned-contrasts}{%
\subsection{Follow-up with planned contrasts}\label{follow-up-with-planned-contrasts}}

We generally try for \emph{orthogonal} contrasts so that the partitioning of variance is independent (clean, not overlapping). Planned contrasts are a great way to do this. Here's where we are in the workflow.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/wfMain_Plnd.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

If you aren't extremely careful about your order-of-operations in R, it can confuse objects, so I have named these contrasts \emph{main\_c1} and \emph{main\_c2} to remind myself that they refer to the main effect of ethnicity of the rater.

In this hypothetical scenario (remember we are pretending we are in the circumstance of a non-significant interaction effect but a significant main effect), I am:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Constrast \#1: comparing the DV for the Javanese rater to the combined Dayaknese and Madurese raters.
\item
  Contrast \#2: comparing the DV for the Dayaknese and Madurese raters.
\end{itemize}

These are orthogonal because:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there are \emph{k} - 1 comparisons, and
\item
  once a contrast is isolated (i.e., the Javanese rater in contrast \#1) it cannot be used again

  \begin{itemize}

Polynomial contrasts let us see if there is a linear (or curvilinear) pattern to the data. To detect a trend, the data must be coded in an ascending order\ldots and it needs to be a sensible comparison. Here's where this would fall in our workflow.

\includegraphics{images/factorial/wfMain_Poly.jpg}
Because these three ethnic groups are not \emph{ordered} in the same way as would an experiment involving dosage (e.g,. placebo, lo dose, hi dose), evaluation of the polynomial trend is not really justified (even though it is statistically possible). None-the-less, I will demonstrate how it is conducted.

First, I am reluctant to term anything ``final.'' It seems like there is always the possibility or revision. Given that I demonstrated a number of options, let me first show the workflow with the particular path I took:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/factorial/WrkFlw_mypath.jpg}
\caption{Image our place in the Two-Way ANOVA Workflow.}
\end{figure}

In light of that, here's the final write-up:

\textbf{Results}

A 3 X 2 ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the effects of rater ethnicity (3 levels, Dayaknese, Madurese, Javanese) and photo stimulus (2 levels, Dayaknese on Madurese,) on negative reactions to the photo stimuli. Results of Levene's test for equality of error variances indicated violation of the assumption, (\(F\){[}5, 105{]} = 8.834, \(p\) \textless{} .001). Our analysis of the individual cell means (see Table 1 for means and standard deviations) suggested skew and kurtosis were within the bounds considered to be normally distributed \citep{kline_principles_2016}. A non-significant Shapiro-Wilk normality test (applied to the residuals from the factorial ANOVA model) provided further evidence that the assumption of normality was not violated (\(W\) = 0.9846, \(p\) = 0.234).

Computing sums of squares with a Type II approach, the results for the ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for ethnicity of the rater (\emph{F}{[}2, 105{]} = 8.077, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.107), a significant main effect for photo stimulus, (\emph{F}{[}1, 105{]} = 19.346, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.127), and a significant interaction effect (\emph{F}{[}2, 105{]} = 5.696, \emph{p} = .004, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.075).

To explore the interaction effect, we followed with a test of the simple main effect of photo stimulus within the ethnicity of the rater. That is, we looked at the effect of the photo stimulus within the Dayaknese, Madurese, and Javanese groups, separately. To control for Type I error across the three simple main effects, we set alpha at .017 (.05/3). Results indicated significant differences for Dayaknese (\emph{F} {[}1, 33{]} = 50.4, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.60.) and Javanese ethnic groups (\emph{F} {[}1, 35{]}= 17.18, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta ^{2}\) = 0.33), but not for the Madurese ethnic group (\emph{F} {[}1, 37{]} = 0.000, \emph{p} = .993, \(\eta ^{2}\) \textless{} .001). As illustrated in Figure 1, the Dayaknese and Javanese rathers both reported stronger negative reactions to the Madurese. The differences in ratings for the Madurese were not statistically significantly different. In this way, the rater's ethnic group moderated the relationship between the photo stimulus and negative reactions.

As is common in simulations, our results approximate the findings reported in the manuscript, but does not replicate them exactly. Our main and interaction effects map on very closely. However, in the follow-up tests, while our findings that Dayaknese rated the Madurese photos more negatively, the findings related to the Javanese' and Madurese' ratings wiggled around some. A close look at the figures can explain that with varying variability and means with similar values, this is probable. I find it to be a useful lesson in ``what it takes'' to get stable, meaningful results.

\hypertarget{options-for-assumption-violations}{%
\section{Options for Assumption Violations}\label{options-for-assumption-violations}}

In one-way ANOVA we could simply apply the Welch's alternative. It's not so easy in factorial ANOVA. One alternative, though, is to change the sums of squares type used in the ANOVA calculations.

In ANOVA models sums of squares can be calculated four different ways: Type I, II, III, and IV. This matters.

SS Type II is the \emph{aov()} default. It may be a best practice to go ahead and specify the SS Type in both the \emph{aov()}, eta-squared, and apaTables script so that they are consistent.

\textbf{Type I} sums of squares is similar to hierarchical linear regression in that the first predictor in the model claims as much variance as it can and the leftovers are claimed by the variable entered next -- each claiming as much as possible leaving the leftovers for what follows. Unless the variables are completely independent of each other (unlikely), Type I sums of squares cannot evaluate the true main effect of each variable. Type I should not be used to evaluate main effects and interactions because the order of predictors will affect the results.

\textbf{Type II} (the R default) is appropriate if you are interested main effects because it ignores the effect of any interactions involving the main effect. Thus, variance from a main effect is not ``lost'' to any interaction terms containing that effect. Type II is appropriate for main effects analyses only, but should not be used when evaluating interaction effects. Type II sums of squares is not affected by the type of contrast coding used to specify the predictor variables.

\textbf{Type III} is the default in many stats packages -- but not R. In Type III all effects (main effects and interactions) are evaluated (simultaneously) taking into consideration all other effects in the model (not just the ones entered before). Type III is more robust to unequal samples sizes (e.g., unbalanced designs). Type III is best when predictors are encoded with orthogonal contrasts.

*\textbf{Type IV} is identical to Type III except it requires no missing cells.

Field \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} suggested that it is safest to stick with Type III sums of squares . We apply the type to the model we create in the initial run. For more information, check out this explanation on \href{https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/03/anova-\%E2\%80\%93-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/}{r-bloggers}.

Many researchers automatically use Type III as the SS type. Today I went with the R default because

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type II sums of squares was used in hand-calculations,
\item
  Our example was reasonably balanced (equal cell sizes), and
\item
  We had only violated the homogeneity of variance assumption.
\end{itemize}

For demonstration purposes, let's run the Type III alternative to see the differences:

Note that the sums of squares are somewhat different between models -- and that the Type III tests includes an intercept. In today's example, the statistical significance remains the same across the models.

The Type III effect size for Rater is higher; the others are quite similar.

\hypertarget{power}{%
\section{Power}\label{power}}

Asking about \emph{power} can be a euphemistic way of asking, ``How large should my sample size be?''

Power is defined as the ability of the test to detect statistical significance when there is such. It's represented formulaically as (1 - \emph{P})(Type II error). Power is traditionally set at 80\% (or .8)

We will do both -- evaluate the power of our current example and then work backwards to estimate the sample size needed (which is our usual question for MRPs and dissertations).

We'll use the \emph{pwr.2way()} function from the \emph{pwr2} package.
Helpful resources are found here:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr2/pwr2.pdf}
\item
  \url{https://rdrr.io/cran/pwr2/man/ss.2way.html}
\end{itemize}

The \emph{pwr.2way()} and \emph{ss.2way()} functions require the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{a} number of groups in Factor A
\item
  \textbf{b} number of groups in Factor B
\item
  \textbf{alpha} significant level (Type I error probaility)
\item
  \textbf{beta} Type II error probability (Power = 1 - beta; traditionally set at .1 or .2)
\item
  \textbf{f.A} the \emph{f} effect size of Factor A
\item
  \textbf{f.B} the \emph{f} effect size of Factor B
\item
  \textbf{B} Iteration times, default is 100
\end{itemize}

Hints for calculating the \emph{f.A} and \emph{f.B} values:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this case, we will rerun the statistic, grab both effect sizes, and convert them to the \emph{f} (not the \(f^2\))

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    calculation can be straightforward, either use an online calculator, a hand-calculated formula, or the \emph{eta2\_to\_f} function from the \emph{effectsize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When an effect size is unknown, you can substitute what you expect using Cohen's guidelines of .10, .25, and .40 as small, medium, and large (for the \emph{f}, not \(F^2\))
\end{itemize}

Let's quickly rerun our model to get both the df and calculate the \emph{f} effect value

If we want to understand power in our analysis, we need to convert our effect size for the \emph{interaction} to \(f\) effect size (this is not the same as the \emph{F} test). The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function.

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that offer differing levels of difficulty. Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in factorial-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects

  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-1}{%

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If two-way ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210731)'' from 210731 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}

The Ramdhani et al. \citeyearpar{ramdhani_affective_2018} article has two dependent variables (negative and positive evaluation). Each is suitable for two-way ANOVA.

In the prior lessons, a critical assumption is that the observations must be ``independent.'' That is, related people (partners, parent/child, manager/employee) cannot comprise the data and there cannot be multiple waves of data for the same person. Repeated measures ANOVA is created specifically for this \emph{dependent} purpose. This lessons focuses on the one-way repeated measures ANOVA, where we measure changes across time.

\item
  Hand-calculate a one-way repeated measures ANOVAs

\item
  Conduct a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (omnibus and follow-up) in R.
\item
  Interpret output from the one-way repeated measures ANOVA (and follow-up).
\item
  Prepare an APA style results section of the one-way repeated measures ANOVA output.

\item
  Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
\item
  There were no additional variables in this example. However, you'll see we do have an issue with statistical power. Perhaps change the sample size to see if it changes (maybe stabilizes?) the results.

\hypertarget{introducing-one-way-repeated-measures-anova}{%
\section{Introducing One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA}\label{introducing-one-way-repeated-measures-anova}}

There are a couple of typical use cases for one-way repeated measures ANOVA. In the first, the research participant is assessed in multiple conditions -- with no interested in change-over-time.

An example of a research design using this approach occured in the Green and Salkind \citeyearpar{green_using_2014} statistics text, the one-way repeated measures vignette compared teachers' perception of stress when responding to parents, teachers, and school administrators.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oneway_repeated/repeated_conditions.jpg}
\caption{Illustration of a research design appropriate for one-way repeated measures ANOVA}
\end{figure}

Another common use case is about time. The classic design is a pre-test, an intervention, a post-test, and a follow up. In designs like these researchers often hope that there is a positive change from pre-to-post and that that change either stays constant (from post-to-follow-up) or, perhaps, increases even further. The research vignette for this lesson is interested in change-over-time.

\item
  Computing post-hoc comparisons, planned contrasts, or polynomial trends

\hypertarget{research-vignette-3}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-3}}

Amodeo \citep{amodeo_empowering_2018} and colleagues conducted a mixed methods study (qualitative and quantitative) to evaluate the effectiveness of an empowerment, peer-group-based, intervention with participants (\emph{N} = 8) who experienced transphobic episodes. Focus groups used qualitative methods to summarize emergent themes from the program (identity affirmation, self-acceptance, group as support) and a one-way, repeated measures ANOVA provided evidence of increased resilience from pre to three-month followup.

Eight participants (seven transgender women and one genderqueer person) participated in the intervention. The mean age was 28.5 (\emph{SD} = 5.85). All participants were located in Italy.

The within-subjects condition was wave, represented by T1, T2, and T3:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  T1, beginning of training
\item
  Training, three 8-hour days,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    content included identity and heterosexism, sociopolitical issues and minority stress, resilience and empowerment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  T2, at the conclusion of the 3-day training
\item
  Follow-up session 3 months later
\item
  T3, at the conclusion of the +3 month follow-up session
\end{itemize}

The dependent variable (assessed at each wave) was a 14-item resilience scale \citep{wagnild_development_1993}. Items were assessed on a 7-point scale ranging from \emph{strongly disagree} to \emph{strongly agree} with higher scores indicating higher levels of resilience. An example items was, ``I usually manage one way or another.''

Let's take a look at the structure of our variables. We want ID to be a factor, Resilience to be numeric, and Wave to be an ordered factor (Pre, Post, FollowUp).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

 $ Resilience: num  6.49 5.28 5.93 4.43 5.95 ...
\end{verbatim}

We just need to change Wave to be an ordered factor. Because R's default is to order factors alphabetically, we can use the levels command and identify our preferred order.

\textbf{Shape Shifters}

The form of our data matters. The simulation created a \emph{long} form (formally called the \emph{person-period} form) of data. That is, each observation for each person is listed in its own row. In this dataset where we have 8 people with 3 observation (pre, post, follow-up) each, we have 24 rows. This is convenient, because this is the form we need for repeated measures ANOVA.

However, for some of the calculations (particularly those we will do by hand), we need the data to be in its more familiar wide form (formally called the \emph{person level} form). We can do this with the \emph{data.table} and \emph{reshape2}()* packages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this reshape script, I asked for a quick structure check. The format of the variables looks correct.

If you want to export these data as files to your computer, remove the hashtags to save (and re-import) them as .rds (R object) or .csv (``Excel lite'') files. This is not a necessary step to continue working the problem in this lesson.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. I would choose this option.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}
\CommentTok{\#saveRDS(Amodeo\_long, "Amodeo\_longRDS.rds")}
\CommentTok{\#saveRDS(Amodeo\_wide, "Amodeo\_wideRDS.rds")}
\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file}
\CommentTok{\#Amodeo\_long \textless{}{-} readRDS("Amodeo\_longRDS.rds")}
\CommentTok{\#Amodeo\_wide \textless{}{-} readRDS("Amodeo\_wideRDS.rds")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Another option is to write them as .csv files. The code for .csv will likely lose any variable formatting, but the .csv file is easy to view and manipulate in Excel. If you choose this option, you will probably need to re-run the prior code to reformat Wave as an ordered factor

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#write the simulated data  as a .csv}
\CommentTok{\#write.table(Amodeo\_long, file="Amodeo\_longCSV.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)}

\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file}

In the following output, note the order of presentation of the grouping variable (i.e., FollowUp, Post, Pre). Even though we have ordered our factor so that ``Pre'' is first, the \emph{describeBy()} function seems to be ordering them alphabetically.

Our means suggest that resilience increases from pre to post, then declines a bit. We use one-way repeated measures ANOVA to learn if there are statistically significant differences between the pairs of means and over time.

\section{Working the One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA (by hand)}\label{working-the-one-way-repeated-measures-anova-by-hand}}

Before working our problem in R, let's gain a conceptual understanding by partitioning the variance by hand.

In repeated measures ANOVA: \(SS_T = SS_B + SS_W\), where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  B = between-subjects variance
\item
  W = within-subjects variance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(SS_W = SS_M + SS_R\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

What differs is that \(SS_M\) and \(SS_R\) (model and residual) are located in \(SS_W\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(SS_T = SS_B + (SS_M + SS_R)\)
\end{itemize}

Our formulas for \(SS_{T}\) are the same as they were for one-way and factorial ANOVA:

\[SS_{T}= \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}_{grand})^{2}\]
\[SS_{T}= s_{grand}^{2}(n-1)\]
Degrees of freedom for \(SS_T\) is \emph{N} - 1, where \emph{N} is the total number of cells.

Let's take a moment to \emph{hand-calculate} \(SS_{T}\) (but using R).

Our grand (i.e., overall) mean is

In this case, we are interested in change in resilience over time. Hence, \emph{time} is our factor. In our equation, we have three chunks representing the pre, post, and follow-up \emph{conditions} (waves). From each, we subtract the grand mean, square it, and multiply by the \emph{n} observed in each wave.

The degrees of freedom (df) for \(SS_M\) is \emph{k} - 1

Let's calculate grand mean; that is the resilience score for all participants across all waves.

Our example has 2 (numerator) and 14 (denominator) degrees of freedom. If we use a table we find the corresponding degrees of freedom combinations for the column where \(\alpha = .05\). We observe that any \(F\) value \textgreater{} 3.73 will be statistically significant. Our \(F\) = 3.87, so we have (just barely) exceeded the threshold. This is our \emph{omnibus F}. We know there is at least 1 statistically significant difference between our pre, post, and follow-up conditions.

We will start by testing the assumptions. Highlighting in the figure notes our place in the one-way ANOVA workflow:

\caption{Image of our position in the workflow for the one-way repeated measures ANOVA}
\end{figure}

There are several different ways to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA. Each has different assumptions/requirements. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  univariate statistics

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is what we will use today.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  multivariate statistics

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Functionally similar to univariate, except the underlying algorithm does not require the sphericity assumption.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  multi-level modeling/hierarchical linear modeling

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This a different statistic altogether and is addressed in the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/MultilevelModeling}{multilevel modeling OER}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{univariate-assumptions-for-repeated-measures-anova}{%
\subsubsection{Univariate assumptions for repeated measures ANOVA}\label{univariate-assumptions-for-repeated-measures-anova}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The cases represent a random sample from the population.
\item
  There is no dependency in the scores \emph{between} participants.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Of course there is intentional dependency in the repeated measures (or within-subjects) factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are no significant outliers in any cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check by visualizing the data using box plots. The \emph{identify\_outliers()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package identifies extreme outliers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for each level of the within-subjects factor.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality for each of the levels of the DV.
  \item
    Visually examine Q-Q plots.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The population variance of difference scores computed between any two levels of a within-subjects factor is the same value regardless of which two levels are chosen; termed the \textbf{sphericity assumption}. This assumption is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    akin to compound symmetry (both variances across conditions are equal).
  \item
    akin to the homogeneity of variance assumption in between-group designs.
  \item
    sometimes called the homogeneity-of-variance-of-differences assumption.
  \item
    statistically evaluated with \emph{Mauchly's test.} If Mauchly's \emph{p} \textless{} .05, there are statistically significant differences. The \emph{anova\_test()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package reports Mauchly's and two alternatives to the traditional \emph{F} that correct the values by the degree to which the sphericity assumption is violated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{demonstrating-sphericity}{%
\subsubsection{Demonstrating sphericity}\label{demonstrating-sphericity}}

Using the data from our motivating example, I calculated differences for each of the time variables. These are the three columns (in green shading) on the right. The variance for each is reported at the bottom of the column.

When we get into the analysis, we will use \emph{Mauchly's test} in hopes that there are non-significant differences in variances between all three of the comparisons.

We are only concerned with the sphericity assumption if there are three or more groups.

\[variance_{A-B} \approx variance_{A-C}\approx variance_{B-C}\]

\hypertarget{any-outliers}{%
\subsubsection{Any outliers?}\label{any-outliers}}

The boxplot is one common way for identifying outliers. The boxplot uses the median and the lower (25th percentile) and upper (75th percentile) quartiles. The difference bewteen Q3 and Q1 is the \emph{interquartile range} (IQR). Outliers are generally identified when values fall outside these lower and upper boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 1.5xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 1.5xIQR
\end{itemize}

Extreme values occur when values fall outside these boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 3xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 3xIQR
\end{itemize}

Let's take a look at a boxplot.

Our skew and kurtosis values fall below the thresholds of concern \citep{kline_principles_2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textless{} 3 for skew
\item
  8 - 20 indicates extreme skew for kurtosis
\end{itemize}

We can use the Shapiro-Wilk test for a formal detection of normality. When \emph{p} \textless{} .05, it indicates that the distribution is statistically significantly different than a normal one. Therefore, \emph{p} \textgreater{} .05 indicates we did not violate the normal distribution assumption. The code below groups the DV by wave so that we can test normality for each cell in the model.

The \emph{p} value is \textgreater{} .05 for each of the cells. This provides some assurance that we have not violated the assumption of normality at any level of the design.

The Shapiro-Wilk test is sensitive to sample size \citep{datanovia_repeated_nodate}. Samples \textgreater{} 50 may lead to \emph{p} values that are \textless{} .05, even when non-normality is not problematic. Therefore a second check with a Q-Q plot can be helpful. In a normal distribution the residuals will align along the line for each of the cells in the model.

\textbf{APA Assumption Write-up So Far}

Repeated measures ANOVA has several assumptions regarding outliers, normality, and sphericity. Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{identify\_outliers()} function in the \emph{rstatix} package (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated no outliers. Regarding normality, no values of skew and kurtosis (at each wave of assessment) fell within cautionary ranges for skew and kurtosis \citep{kline_principles_2016}. Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk tests applied at each wave of the design were non-significant.

\hypertarget{assumption-of-sphericity}{%
\subsubsection{Assumption of Sphericity}\label{assumption-of-sphericity}}

The sphericity assumption is automatically checked with Mauchley's test during the computation of the ANOVA when the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} function is used. When the \emph{rstatix::get\_anova\_table()} function is used, the Greenhouse-Geisser sphericity correction is automatically applied to factors violating the sphericity assumption.

The effect size, \(\eta^2\) is reported in the column labeled ``ges.''

Earlier in the lesson I noted that the evaluation of the sphericity assumption occurs at the same time that we evaluate the omnibus ANOVA. We are at that point in the analyses. The workflow points to our stage in the process.

\hypertarget{omnibus-repeated-measures-anova}{%
\subsection{Omnibus Repeated Measures ANOVA}\label{omnibus-repeated-measures-anova}}

As we prepare to run the omnibus ANOVA it may be helpful to think again about our variables. Our DV, Resilience, should be a continuous variable. In R, its structure should be ``num.'' Our predictor, Wave, should be categorical. In R case, Wave should be an ordered factor that is consistent with its timing: pre, post, follow-up.

The repeated measures ANOVA must be run with a long form of the data. This means that there needs to be a within-subjects identifier. In our case, it is the ``ID'' variable which is also formatted as a factor.

We can verify the format of our variables by examining the structure of our dataframe. Recall that we created the ``m\_dev'' and ``m\_devSQ'' variables earlier in the demonstration. We will not use them in this analysis; it does not harm anything for them to ``ride along'' in the dataframe.

We can assemble our \emph{F} string from the ANOVA object: \(F(2,14) = 3.91, p = 0.045, \eta^2 = 0.203\)

From the Mauchly's Test for Sphericity object we learn that we did not violate the sphericity assumption: \(W = 0.566, p = .182\)

From the Sphericity Corrections object are output for two alternative corrections to the \emph{F} statistic, the Greenhouse-Geiser epsilon (GGe), and Huynh-Feldt epsilon (HFe). Because we did not violate the sphericity assumption we do not need to use them. Notice that these two tests adjust our df (both numerator and denominator) to have a more conservative p value.

If we needed to write an \emph{F} string that is corrected for violation of the sphericity assumption, it might look like this:

The Greenhouse Geiser estimate was 0.698 the correct omnibus was \emph{F}(1.4, 9.77) = 3.91, \emph{p} = .068.
The Huyhn Feldt estimate was 0.817 and the corrected omnibus was \emph{F} (1.63, 11.44) = 3.91 \emph{p} = .057.

You might be surprised that we are at follow-up already.

Although we had a statistically significant omnibus test, we did not obtain statistically significant results in an of the posthoc pairwise comparisons. Why not?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Our omnibus \emph{F} was right at the margins

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a larger sample size (assuming that the effects would hold) would have been more powerful.
  \item
    there could be significance if we compared pre to the combined effects of post and follow-up.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

How would we manage Type I error? With only three possible post-omnibus comparisons, I would cite the Tukey LSD approach and not adjust the alpha to a more conservative level \citep{green_using_2014}.

We can combine information from the object we created (``bxp'') from an earlier boxplot with the object we saved from the posthoc pairwise comparisons (``pwc) to enhance our boxplot with the \emph{F} string and indications of pairwise significant (or, in our case, non-significance).

Unfortunately, the \emph{apaTables} package does not work with the \emph{rstatix} package, so a table would need to be crafted by hand.

\hypertarget{results-section}{%
\subsection{Results Section}\label{results-section}}

Repeated measures ANOVA has several assumptions regarding outliers, normality, and sphericity. Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated no outliers. Regarding normality, no values of skew and kurtosis (at each wave of assessment) fell within cautionary ranges for skew and kurtosis \citep{kline_principles_2016}. Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk tests applied at each wave of the design were non-significant. A non-significant Mauchley's test (\(W = 0.566, p = .182\)) indicated that the sphericity assumption was not violated.

The omnibus ANOVA was significant: \(F(2,14) = 3.91, p = 0.045, \eta^2 = 0.203\). We followed up with all pairwise comparisons. Curiously, and in spite of a significant omnibus test, there were not statistically significant differences between any of the pairs. Regarding pre versus post, \emph{t} = -2.15, \emph{p}= .069. Regarding pre versus follow-up, \emph{t} = -2.00, \emph{p} = .068. Regarding post versus follow-up, \emph{t} = 1.059, \emph{p} = .325. Because there were only three pairwise comparisons subsequent to the omnibus test, alpha was retained at .05 \citep{green_using_2014}. While the trajectories from pre-to-post and pre-to-follow-up were in the expected direction, the small sample size likely contributed to a Type II error. Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1 and the differences are illustrated in Figure 1.

While I have not located a package that will take \emph{rstatix} output to make an APA style table, we can use the \emph{MASS} package to write the pwc object to a .csv file, then manually make our own table.

How do our findings and our write-up from the simulated data compare with the original article?

The \emph{F} string is presented in the Table 1 note (\emph{F}{[}1.612, 11.283{]}) = 6.390, \emph{p} = 0.18, \(\eta _{p}^{2}\)). We can tell from the fractional degrees of freedom that the \emph{p} value has been had a correction for violation of the sphericity assumption.

Table 1 also reports all of the post-hoc, pairwise comparisons. There is no mention of control for Type I error. Had they used a traditional Bonferroni, they would have needed to reduce the alpha to (k*(k-1)/2) and then divide .05 by that number.

Although they report 6 comparisons; 3 are repeated because they are merely in reverse. Yet, the revised alpha would be .016 and the one, lone, comparison would not have been statistically significant. That said, we can use the Tukey LSD because there are only 3 comparisons and holding alpha at .05 can be defended \citep{green_using_2014}.

\section{Power in Repeated Measures ANOVA}\label{power-in-repeated-measures-anova}}

The package \emph{wp.rmanova} was designed for power analysis in repeated measures ANOVA.

Power analysis allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. Especially when we don't achieve significance, we may want to stop.

In the \emph{WebPower} package, we specify 6 of 7 interrelated elements; the package computes the missing one.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size (number of individuals in the whole study)
\item
  \emph{ng} = number of groups
\item
  \emph{nm} = number of measurements/conditions/waves
\item
  \emph{f} = Cohen's \emph{f} (an effect size; we can use a conversion calculator)
\item
  \emph{nscor} = the Greenhouse Geiser correction from our ouput; 1.0 means no correction was needed and is the package's default; \textless{} 1 means some correction was applied.
\item
  \emph{alpha} = is the probability of Type I error; we traditionally set this at .05
\item
  \emph{power} = 1 - P(Type II error) we traditionally set this at .80 (so anything less is less than what we want)
\item
  \emph{type} = 0 is for between-subjects, 1 is for repeated measures, 2 is for interaction effect.
\end{itemize}

I used \emph{effectsize} packages converter to transform our \(\eta^2\) to Cohen's \emph{f}.

Here we learned that we were only powered at .16. That is, we had a 16\% chance of finding a statistically significant effect if, in fact, it existed. This is low!

In reverse, setting \emph{power} at .80 (the traditional value) and changing \emph{n} to \emph{NULL} yields a recommended sample size.

In many cases we won't know some of the values in advance. We can make best guesses based on our review of the literature. In the script below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{nscor} is the degree of violation of the sphericity assumption. If we think we won't violate it, we can enter 1.0 or leave it out (the wp.rmanova default is 1.0)
\item
  \emph{f} is the effect size estimate; Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

With these new values, we learn that we would need 50 individuals in order to feel confident in our ability to get a statistically significant result if, in fact, it existed.

The focus of this lecture is mixed design ANOVA. That is, we are conducting a two-way ANOVA where one of the factors is repeated measures and one of the factors is between groups. The mixed design ANOVA is often associated with the random clinical trial (RCT) where the researcher hopes for a significant interaction effect. Specifically, the researcher hopes that the individuals who were randomly assigned to the treatment condition improve from pre-test to post-test and maintain (or continue to improve) after post-test, while the people assigned to the no-treatment control are not statistically significantly different from treatment group at pre-test, and do not improve over time.

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-5}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate the suitability of a research design/question and dataset for conducting a mixed design ANOVA; identify alternatives if the data is not suitable.
\item
  Test the assumptions for mixed design ANOVA.
\item
  Conduct a mixed design ANOVA (omnibus and follow-up) in R.
\item
  Interpret output from the mixed design ANOVA (and follow-up).
\item
  Prepare an APA style results section of the mixed design ANOVA output.
\item
  Conduct a power analysis for mixed design ANOVA.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-4}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-4}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. The Murrar and Brauer \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article has three variables (attitudes toward Arabs, attitudes toward Whites, and a difference score) which are suitable for mixed design ANOVAs. I will demonstrate a mixed design ANOVA with the difference score. I'll leave the other two variables for opportunities for practice.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for two-way ANOVA. IIn either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a mixed design ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\section{Introducing Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{introducing-mixed-design-anova}}

Mixed design ANOVA is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at least two independent variables.\\
\item
  Termed ``mixed'' because

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    one is a between-subjects factor, and
  \item
    one is a repeated-measures (i.e., within-subjects) factor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In essence, we are simultaneously conducting

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a one-way independent ANOVA and a
  \item
    a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Especially when there is a significant interaction there can be numerous ways to follow up. We will work one set of analyses: simple main effects (condition within wave; wave within condition) and, when needed, conduct posthoc pairwise comparisons as follow-up. Other good options include identifying a priori contrasts and conducting polynomials (not demonstrated in this lecture).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mixed/mx_workflow.jpg}
\caption{Image of a workflow for mixed design ANOVA}
\end{figure}

The steps in working the mixed design generally include,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Exploring the data/evaluating the assumptions
\item
  Evaluating the omnibus test
\item
  Follow-up to the omnibus

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if significant interaction effect: simple main effects and further follow-up to those
  \item
    if significant main effect (but no significant interaction effect), identify source of significance in the main effect
  \item
    if no significance, stop
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Write it up with tables, figure(s)
\end{enumerate}

Assumptions for the mixed design ANOVA include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dependent variable should be continuous with no significant outliers in any cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check by visualizing the data using box plots and by using the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The DV should be approximately normally distributed in each cell of the design

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check with Shapiro-Wilk normality test \emph{rstatix::shapiro\_test()} function and with visual inspection by creating Q-Q plots. The \emph{ggpubr::ggqqplot()} function is a great tool.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The variances of the differences between groups should be equal. This is termed the \textbf{sphericity assumption.} This can be checked with Mauchly's test of sphericity, which is reported automatically in the \emph{rstatix::anova\_test()} output.
\end{itemize}

The best way to address violations of these assumptions is not always clear. Possible solutions include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For 2- and 3- way ANOVAs, violations of the normality assumption might be addressed by removing extreme outliers or considering transformations of the data. Transformations, though, introduce their own compexities regarding interpretation. Kline's text \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} provides excellent coverage of options.
\item
  A robust ANOVA option is available in the \emph{WRS2} package
\item
  If there are three or more waves/conditions and the sample is large, it may be possible to run a multi-level, model.
\item
  In the absence of alternatives, it may be necessary to run the mixed design with the violated assumptions, but report them.
\item
  \ldots.and more. Internet searches continue to offer new approaches and alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-vignette-4}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-4}}

This lesson's research vignette is from Murrar and Brauer's \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article that describes the results of two studies that evaluated interventions designed to reduce prejudice against Arabs/Muslims. We are working only a portion of the first study reported in the article. Participants (\emph{N} = 193), all who were White, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they watched six episodes of the sitcom \href{http://www.friends-tv.org/}{\emph{Friends}} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie}{\emph{Little Mosque on the Prairie}}. The sitcoms and specific episodes were selected after significant pilot testing. The selection was based on the tension selecting stimuli that were as similar as possible, yet the intervention-oriented sitcom needed to invoke psychological processes known to reduce prejudice. The authors felt that both series had characters that were likable and relatable and were engaged in regular activities of daily living. The Friends series featured characters who were predominantly White, cis-gendered, and straight. The Little Mosque series portrayed the experience of Western Muslims and Arabs as they lived in a small Canadian town. This study involved assessment across three waves: baseline (before watching the assigned episodes), post1 (immediately after watching the episodes), and post2 (completed 4-6 weeks after watching the episodes).

The study used \emph{feelings and liking thermometers}, rating their feelings and liking toward 10 different groups of people on a 0 to 100 sliding scale (with higher scores reflecting greater liking and positive feelings). For the purpose of this analysis, the ratings of attitudes toward White people and attitudes toward Arabs/Muslims were used. A third metric was introduced by subtracting the attitudes towards Arabs/Muslims from the attitudes toward Whites. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes toward Whites where as low scores indicated no difference in attitudes. To recap, there were three potential dependent variables, all continuously scaled:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{AttWhite}: attitudes toward White people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  \emph{AttArab}: attitudes toward Arab people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  \emph{Diff}: the difference between AttWhite and AttArab; higher scores reflect a greater liking for White people
\end{itemize}

With random assignment, nearly equal cell sizes, a condition with two levels (Friends, Little Mosque), and three waves (baseline, post1, post2), this is perfect for mixed design ANOVA.

\subsection{Simulating the data from the journal article}\label{simulating-the-data-from-the-journal-article}}

Below is the code I have used to simulate the data. The simulation includes two dependent variables (AttWhite, AttArab), Wave (baseline, post1, post2), and COND (condition; Friends, Little\_Mosque). There is also a caseID (repeated three times across the three waves) and rowID (giving each observation within each case an ID). This creates the long-file, where each person has 3 rows of data representing baseline, post1, and post2. You can use this simulation for two of the three practice suggestions.

A key dependent variable in the Murrar and Brauer \citep{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article is \emph{attitude difference.} Specifically, the attitudes toward Arabs score was subtracted from the attitudes toward Whites scores. Higher attitude difference indicate a greater preference for Whites. Let's create that variable, here.

First we inspect the means. We see that the baseline scores for the Friends and Little Mosque conditions are similar. However, the post1 and post2 difference scores (i.e., difference in attitudes toward White and Arab individuals, where higher scores indicate more favorable ratings of White individuals) are higher in the Friends condition than in the Little Mosque condition.

\hypertarget{assumption-of-normality}{%
\subsubsection{Assumption of Normality}\label{assumption-of-normality}}

We can use this output to evaluate the distributional characteristics of the dependent variable. Recall that mixed design ANOVA assumes a normal distribution.

Our values of skew and kurtosis are well within the limits \citep{kline_principles_2016} of a normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  skew: \textless{} 3; the highest skew value in our data is 0.32
\item
  kurtosis: extreme values are between 8 and 20; the highest kurtosis value in our data is .55

The boxplot is one common way for identifying outliers. The boxplot uses the median and the lower (25th percentile) and upper (75th percentile) quartiles. The difference bewteen Q3 and Q1 is the \emph{interquartile range} (IQR).

You'll notice that as we are creating these boxplors we are saving them as objects. This is not necessary to produce the graph. However, we will combine the object with other data, later, to embed results if the anlaysis in our figures.

The distributions look relatively normal with the mean well-centered. Given that we simulated the data from means and standard deviations, this is somewhat expected. This boxplot also provides a glimpse of the patterns in our data. That is, the means are quite similar at baseline; in the post intervention waves we see greater difference scores for the Friends condition.

Let's reconfigure the data by putting the wave on the X axis. Plotting it both ways (i.e.,swapping roles of predictor and moderator) can help us get a sense of what is happening.

Outliers are generally identified when values fall outside these lower and upper boundaries. In the short formulas below, IQR is the \emph{interquartile range} (i.e., the middle 50\%, the distance of the box):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 1.5xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 1.5xIQR
\end{itemize}

Extreme values occur when values fall outside these boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Q1 - 3xIQR
\item
  Q3 + 3xIQR
\end{itemize}

Using the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers} function we can look for outliers in the dependent variable, doubly grouped by our predictor variables.

While we have some outliers (where ``is.outlier'' = ``TRUE''), none are extreme (where ``is.outlier'' = ``FALSE''). We'll keep these in mind as we continue to evaluate the data.

If I had extreme outliers, I would individually inspect them. Especially if something looked awry (e.g., erratic responding extreme scores across variables) I might consider deleting them.

Next we can use the \emph{rstatix::shapiro\_test()} to see if any of the distributions of the dependent variable (Diff) within each wave-by-condition combinations differs significantly from a normal distribution.

In this multivariate sample, the Box's M test evaluates if two or more covariance matrices are homogeneous. Like other tests of assumptions, we want a non-significant test result (i.e., where \emph{p} \textgreater{} .05). Box's M has some disavantages. Box's M has low power in small sample sizes and is overly sensitive in large sample sizes. We would unlikely make a decision about our data with Box's M alone. Rather, we consider it along with our dashboard of diagnostic screeners.

At this stage we are ready to draft the portion of the APA style writeup that evaluates the assumptions.

Mixed design ANOVA has a number of assumptions related to both the within-subjects and between-subjects elements. Data are expected to be normally distributed at each level of design. Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated some outliers, but none at the extreme level. There was no evidence of skew (all values were at or below the absolute value of 0.32) or kurtosis (all values were below the absolute value of .57; \citep{kline_principles_2016}). Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk tests applied at each level of the design were non-significant. Because of the between-subjects aspect of the design, the homogeneity of variance assumption was evaluated. Levene's test indicated a violation of this assumption between the Friends and Little Mosque conditions at baseline \emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 3.973, \emph{p} = .047). However, there was no indication of assumption violation at post1 (\emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 0.141, \emph{p} = .708), and post2 (\emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 0.107, \emph{p} = .743) waves of the design. Further, Box's M-test (\emph{M} = 3.209, \emph{p} = .073) indicated no violation of the homogeneity of covariance matrices. \emph{LATER WE WILL ADD INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPHERICITY ASSUMPTION.}

\hypertarget{omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Omnibus ANOVA}\label{omnibus-anova}}

Having evaluated the assumptions (excepting sphericity) we are ready to move to the evaluation of the omnibus ANOVA. This next step produces both the omnibus test as well as testing the sphericity assumption. Conceptually, evaluating the sphericity assumption precedes the omnibus; procedurally these are evaluated simultaneously. The figure also reflects that decisions related to follow-up are dependent upon the significance of the main and omnibus effects.

If we are ever confused about a function, we can place a question mark in front of it. It will summons information and, if the package is in our library, let us know to which package it belongs and open the instructions that are embedded in R/R Studio.

\hypertarget{checking-the-sphericity-assumption}{%
\subsubsection{Checking the sphericity assumption}\label{checking-the-sphericity-assumption}}

First, we check Mauchly's test for the main and interaction effects that involve the repeated measures variable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main effect for Wave: \emph{W} = .99, \emph{p} = .369
\item
  main effect for Wave: \emph{W} = .99, \emph{p} = .369
\end{itemize}

We will be able to add this statement to our assumptions write-up: Mauchly's test indicated no violation of the sphericity assumption for the main effect (\emph{W} = 0.99, \emph{p} = .369) and interaction effect (\emph{W} = 0.99, \emph{p} = .369).

If the \emph{p} vaue associated with Mauchly's test had been less than .05, we could have used one of the two options (Greenhouse Geyser/GGe or Huynh-Feldt/HFe). In each of these an epsilon value provides an adjustment to the degrees of freedom used in the estimation of the \emph{p} value. There is also an option to use a multivariate approach when ANOVA designs include a repeated measures factor.

\textbf{Omnibus Results}

Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for condition (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 13.149, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.023), a non-significant main effect for wave (\emph{F}{[}2, 382{]} = 0.273, \emph{p} = .761, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.001), and a significant interaction effect (\emph{F}{[}2, 382{]} = 5.008, \emph{p} = 0.007, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.017). We note that according to Cohen et al.'s \citep{cohen_applied_2003} guidelines, the effect size for the interaction term is small.

In the output, the column labeled ``ges'' provides the value for the effect size, \(\eta^{2}\). Recall that \emph{eta-squared} is one of the most commonly used measures of effect. It refers to the proportion of variability in the dependent variable/outcome that can be explained in terms of the independent variable/predictor. Traditional interpretive values are similar to the Pearson's \emph{r}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  0 = no relationship
\item
  .02 = small
\item
  .13 = medium
\item
  .26 = large
\item
  1 = a perfect (one-to-one) correspondence
\end{itemize}

The effect size for our interaction effect (0.017) is small.

With a significant interaction effect, we would focus on interpreting one or both of the simple main effects. Let's first look at the simple main effect of condition within wave option.

\hypertarget{simple-main-effect-of-condition-within-wave}{%
\subsection{Simple main effect of condition within wave}\label{simple-main-effect-of-condition-within-wave}}

In prior lectures we have adjusted the \emph{p} value against which we compare the resulting \emph{p} value. When we specify ``bonferroni'' on the \emph{adjust\_pvalue()} command, the algorithm adjusts the reported \emph{p} value for us. We can see the unadjusted \emph{p} value in the ``p p\textless.05'' column and the Bonferroni adjustment in the ``p.adj'' column.

I think that it will be easiest for us to interpret this simple main effect as the traditional \emph{p} \textless{} .05 and then apply the restrictions to the alpha at the next level of analysis In this particular instance, we would have statistically significant differences somewhere between the Friends and Little Mosque conditions for both the Post (\emph{p} = .027) and Post2 (\emph{p} = .010) waves.

F strings:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre: \emph{F} (1, 191) = 0.012, \emph{p} = .914, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.000 (the effect size is zero)
\item
  Post: \emph{F} (1, 191) = 17.497, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.084 (approaching a moderate effect size)
\item
  Post2: \emph{F} (1, 191) = 5.994, \emph{p} = .015, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.030 (a small effect size)
\end{itemize}

Recall, interpretation for the eta-squared are .02 \textasciitilde{} small, .13 \textasciitilde{} medium, and \textgreater.26 \textasciitilde{} large

Because there are only two levels (Friends, Little Mosque) within each wave (baseline, post1, post2), this simple effects analysis is complete with the three pairwise comparisons.

As always, we have several choices about how to manage Type I error. In a circumstance when the analysis of simple main effects (condition within wave) includes only three pairwise comparisons, we can use the LSD method \citep{green_using_2014}. This means that we can we can leave the alpha at 0.05. If we were to use a traditional Bonferroni, we would use \(\alpha\) = .017 (.05/3). Although the more restrictive Bonferroni criteria comes close, in both cases we would still have one non-significant(baseline) and two significant (post1, post2) simple main effects.

If we were to write up this result:

We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of condition within wave. Because there were only three comparisons following the omnibus evaluation, we used the LSD method to control for Type I error and left the alpha at .05 \citep{green_using_2014}. There was a non-statistically significant difference between conditions at baseline: \emph{F} (1, 191) = 0.012, \emph{p} = .914, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.000. However other were statistically significant differences at post1 (\emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 17.497, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.084) and post2 (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 5.994, \emph{p} = .015, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.030). We note that the effect size at post1 approached a moderate size; the effect size at post2 was small.

Below are the \emph{F} strings for the one-way ANOVAs the followed the omnibus, mixed design, ANOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Friends: \emph{F} (2, 194) = 1.759, \emph{p} = 0.175, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.012 (effect size indicates no relationship)
\item
  Little Mosque: \emph{F} (2, 188) = 3.392, \emph{p} = 0.036, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.072 (a small-to-moderate effect size)
\end{itemize}

Because each of these one-way ANOVAs has three levels, we need to follow with pairwise comparisons. However, we only need to conduct them for the Little Mosque condition. As you can see we generally work our way down to comparing chunks to each other to find the source(s) of significant differences.

You will notice that we are saving the results of the pairwise comparisons as an object. This is not necessary, however we can use this object in combination with the boxplot we created earlier to embed results of our analysis in the resulting figure.

At this point, we likely need to control for Type I error. Why? We have already conducted two one-way ANOVAs after the omnibus. Now we will conduct three more pairwise comparisons in the Little Mosque condition. I would divide .05/3 and interpret these pairwise comparisons with an alpha of .017.

We find a significant difference between baseline and post1 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 2.447, \emph{p} = .016), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 1.621, \emph{p} = .108) and post1 and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = -1.034, \emph{p} = .304)

If we were to write up this result:

We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of wave within condition. There were non-significant difference within the the Friends condition (\emph{F} {[}2, 194{]} = 1.759, \emph{p} = 0.175, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.012). There were significant differences with an effect size indicating a small-to-moderate effect in the Little Mosque condition (\emph{F} {[}2, 188{]} = 3.392, \emph{p} = 0.036, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.072). We followed up the significant simple main effect for the Little Mosque condition with pairwiwse comparisons. At this level we controlled for Type I error by dividing alpha (.05) by the number of paired comparisons (3). We found a significant difference between baseline and post1 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 2.447, \emph{p} = .016), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 1.621, \emph{p} = .108) and post1 and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = -1.034, \emph{p} = .304).

\hypertarget{if-we-only-had-a-main-effect}{%
\subsection{If we only had a main effect}\label{if-we-only-had-a-main-effect}}

When there is an interaction effect, we do not interpret main effects. This is because the solution is more complicated than a main effect could explain. It is important, though, to know how to interpret a main effect. We would do this if we had one or more significant main effects and no interaction effect.

The figure shows our place on the workflow.

If we had not had a significant interaction, but did have a significant main effect for wave, we could have conducted pairwise comparisons for pre, post1, and post2 -- collapsing across condition.

Ignoring condition (Friends, Little Mosque), we do not see changes across time. This is not surprising since the \emph{F} test for the main effect was also non-significant (\emph{F}{[}2, 382{]} = 0.273, \emph{p} = .761, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.0014),

If we had had a non-significant interaction effect but a significant main effect for condition, there would have been no need for further follow-up. Why? Because there were only two levels the significant main effect already tells us there were statistically significant differences between Friends and Little Mosque (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 13.149, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.023).

\subsubsection{Results}\label{results-1}}

We conducted a 2 X 3 mixed design ANOVA to evaluate the combined effects of condition (Friends and Little Mosque) and wave (baseline, post1, post2) on a difference score that compared attitudes toward White and Arab people.

Mixed design ANOVA has a number of assumptions related to both the within-subjects and between-subjects elements. Data are expected to be normally distributed at each level of design. Visual inspection of boxplots for each wave of the design, assisted by the \emph{rstatix::identify\_outliers()} function (which reports values above Q3 + 1.5xIQR or below Q1 - 1.5xIQR, where IQR is the interquartile range) indicated some outliers, but none at the extreme level. There was no evidence of skew (all values were at or below the absolute value of 0.32) or kurtosis (all values were below the absolute value of .57; \citep{kline_principles_2016}). Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk tests applied at each level of the design were non-significant. Because of the between-subjects aspect of the design, the homogeneity of variance assumption was evaluated. Levene's test indicated a violation of this assumption between the Friends and Little Mosque conditions at baseline \emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 3.973, \emph{p} = .047). However, there was no indication of assumption violation at post1 (\emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 0.141, \emph{p} = .708), and post2 (\emph{F} {[}1, 191{]} = 0.107, \emph{p} = .743) waves of the design. Further, Box's M-test (\emph{M} = 3.209, \emph{p} = .073) indicated no violation of the homogeneity of covariance matrices. Mauchly's test indicated no violation of the sphericity assumption for the main effect (\emph{W} = 0.99, \emph{p} = .369) and interaction effect (\emph{W} = 0.99, \emph{p} = .369).

Results of the omnibus ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for condition (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 13.149, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.023), a non-significant main effect for wave (\emph{F}{[}2, 382{]} = 0.273, \emph{p} = .761, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.001), and a significant interaction effect (\emph{F}{[}2, 382{]} = 5.008, \emph{p} = 0.007, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.017).

We followed the significant interaction effect with an evaluation of simple main effects of wave within condition. There were non-significant difference within the the Friends condition (\emph{F} {[}2, 194{]} = 1.759, \emph{p} = 0.175, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.012). There were significant differences with an effect size indicating a small-to-moderate effect in the Little Mosque condition (\emph{F} {[}2, 188{]} = 3.392, \emph{p} = 0.036, \(\eta^{2}\) = 0.072). We followed up the significant simple main effect for the Little Mosque condition with pairwiwse comparisons. At this level we controlled for Type I error by dividing alpha (.05) by the number of paired comparisons (3). We found a significant difference between baseline and post1 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 2.447, \emph{p} = .016), but non-significant differences between baseline and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = 1.621, \emph{p} = .108) and post1 and post2 (\emph{t}{[}95{]} = -1.034, \emph{p} = .304).

As illustrated in Figure 1 difference scores were comparable at baseline. After the intervention, difference scores increased for those in the Friends condition -- indicating more favorable attitudes toward White people. In contrast, those exposed to the Little Mosque condition had difference scores that were lower. Means and standard deviations are reported in Table 1.

In general, the results of our simulation mapped onto the findings. If you have access to the article I encourage you to examine it as you consider my observations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The authors started their primary analyses of Experiment 1 with independent \emph{t} tests comparing the Friends and Little Mosque conditions within each of the baseline, post1, and post2 waves. This is equivalent to our simple main effects of condition within wave that we conducted as follow-up to the significant interaction effect. It is not clear to me why they did not precede this with a mixed design ANOVA.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The results of the article are presented in their Table 1
  \item
    Our results were comparable in that we found no attitude difference at baseline
  \item
    Similar to the results in the article we found statistically significant differences (with comparable \emph{p} values and effect sizes) at post1 and post2
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With two experiments (each with a number of associated hypotheses) in a single paper there were a large number of analyses conducted by the authors. I think they designed tables and figures that provided an efficient and clear review of the study design and their findings.
\item
  This finding is exciting to me. Anti-racism education frequently encourages individuals to expose themselves to content authored/created by individuals from groups with marginalized identities. This finding supports that approach to prejudice reduction.

\section{Power in Mixed Design ANOVA}\label{power-in-mixed-design-anova}}

The package \href{https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/_media/grant/practical_statistica_interior_for_kindle.pdf}{\emph{wp.rmanova}} was designed for power analysis in repeated measures ANOVA.

Power analysis allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence. Especially when we don't achieve significance, we may want to stop.

In the \emph{WebPower} package, we specify 6 of 7 interrelated elements; the package computes the missing element

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{n} = sample size (number of individuals in the whole study)
\item
  \emph{ng} = number of groups
\item
  \emph{nm} = number of repeated measurements (i.e., waves)
\item
  \emph{f} = Cohen's \emph{f} (an effect size; we can use a conversion calculator); Cohen suggests that f values of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively
\item
  \emph{nscor} = the Greenhouse Geiser correction from our ouput; 1.0 means no correction was needed and is the package's default; \textless{} 1 means some correction was applied
\item
  \emph{alpha} = is the probability of Type I error; we traditionally set this at .05
\item
  \emph{power} = 1 - P(Type II error) we traditionally set this at .80 (so anything less is less than what we want)
\item
  \emph{type} = 0 is for between-subjects, 1 is for repeated measures, 2 is for interaction effect; in a mixed design ANOVA we will select ``2''
\end{itemize}

As in the prior lessons, we need to convert our effect size for the \emph{interaction} to \(f\) effect size (this is not the same as the \emph{F} test). The \emph{effectsize} package has a series of converters. We can use the \emph{eta2\_to\_f()} function to translate the \(\eta^{2}\) associated with the interaction effect to Cohen's \emph{f}.

We are powered at .349 (we have a 35\% of rejecting the null hypothesis, if it is true)

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that offer differing levels of difficulty. Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct a two-way (minimally a 2x3), mixed design, ANOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main and interaction effects
  \item
    conduct follow-up testing of simple main effects

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If mixed design ANOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210813)'' from 210813 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}

The Murrar et al. \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article has three dependent variables (attitudes toward people who are Arab, attitudes toward people who are White, and the difference score). I analyzed the difference score. Select one of the other dependent variables. If you do not get a significant interaction, play around with the simulation (changing the sample size, standard deviations, or both) until you get a significant interaction effect.

The focus of this lecture is analysis of covariance. Sticking with the same research vignette as we used for the mixed design ANOVA, we rearrange the variables a bit to see how they work in an ANCOVA design. The results help clarify the distinction between \emph{moderator} and \emph{covariate.}

\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-6}}

There is about just about an hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, plan for an additional hour or two

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-6}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-6}}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define a \emph{covariate} and distinguish it from a \emph{moderator.}
\item
  Recognize the case where ANCOVA is a defensible statistical approach for analyzing the data.
\item
  Name and test the assumptions underlying ANCOVA.
\item
  Analyze, interpret, and write up results for ANCOVA.
\item
  List the conditions that are prerequisite for the appropriate use of a covariate or control variable.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-5}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-5}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results \emph{should} map onto the ones obtained in the lecture.

The second option comes from the research vignette. For this ANCOVA article, I take a lot of liberties with the variables and research design. You could further mix and match for a different ANCOVA constellation.

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for ANCOVA. In either case the practice options suggest that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct an ANCOVA, including

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    omnibus test and effect size
  \item
    report main effects and engage in any follow-up testing
  \item
    interpret results in light of the role of the second predictor variable as a \emph{covariate} (as opposed to the moderating role in the prior lessons)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\section{Introducing Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)}\label{introducing-analysis-of-covariance-ancova}}

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) evaluates the null hypothesis that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  population means on a dependent variable are equal across levels of a factor(s) adjusting for differences on a covariate(s); stated differently -
\item
  the population adjusted means are equal across groups
\end{itemize}

This lecture introduces a distinction between \textbf{moderators} and \textbf{covariates}.

\textbf{Moderator}: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

\textbf{Covariate}: an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable. It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Understanding this difference may be facilitated by understanding one of the assumptions of ANCOVA -- that the slopes relating the covariate to the dependent variable are the same for all groups (i.e., the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption). If this assumption is violated then the between-group differences in adjusted means are not interpretable and the covariate should be treated as a moderator and analyses that assess the simple main effects (i.e., follow-up to a significant interaction) should be conducted.

A one-way ANCOVA requires three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV/factor -- categorical (2 or more)
\item
  DV -- continuous
\item
  covariate -- continuous
\end{itemize}

Green and Salkind \citep{green_one-way_2014} identified common uses of ANCOVA:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Studies with a pretest and random assignment of subjects to factor levels. Variations on this research design include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    assignment to factor levels based on that pretest,
  \item
    matching based on the pretest, and random assignment to factor levels,
  \item
    simply using the pretest as a covariate for the posttest DV.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Studies with a potentially confounding variable (best when there is theoretical justification and prior empirical evidence for such) over which the researcher wants ``control''
\end{itemize}

Although it is possible to have multi-way (e.g., 2-way, 3-way) ANCOVA, in this lecture we will only work two, one-way ANCOVAs representing these common use cases.

ANCOVA has four primary assumptions:

\textbf{Linearity}: The covariate is linearly related to the dependent variable within all levels of the factor (IV).

\textbf{Homogeneity of regression slopes}: The weights or slopes relating the covariate to the DV are equal across all levels of the factor.

\textbf{Normally distributed}: The DV is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. This assumption applies to every combination of the values of the covariate and levels ohttps://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/ancova-in-r/f the factor and requires them all to be normally distributed. To the degree that population distributions are not normal and sample sizes are small, \emph{p} values may not be trustworthy and power reduced. Evaluating this is frequently operationalized by inspecting the residuals and identifying outliers.

\textbf{Homogeneity of variances}: The variances of the DV for the conditional distributions (i.e., every combination of the values of the covariate and levels of the factor) are equal.

We are following the approach to analyzing ANCOVA identifed in the Datanovia lesson on ANCOVA \citep{datanovia_ancova_nodate}.

Our analytic process will be similar to others in the ANOVA series:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prepare the data
\item
  Evaluate potential violation of the assumptions
\item
  Compute the omnibus ANCOVA, and follow-up accordingly

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If significant: follow-up with post-hoc comparisons, planned contrasts, and/or polynomial
  \item
    If non-significant: stopping.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

An ANCOVA workflow maps this in further detail.

\hypertarget{research-vignette-5}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-5}}

We will continue with the example used in the \protect\hyperlink{Mixed}{mixed design ANOVA lesson} The article does not contain any ANCOVA analyses, but there is enough data that I can demonstrate the two general ways (i.e., controlling for the pretest, controlling for a potentially confounding variable) that ANCOVA is used.

Here is a quick reminder of the research vignette.

Murrar and Brauer's \citeyearpar{murrar_entertainment-education_2018} article described the results of two studies designed to reduce prejudice against Arabs/Muslims. In the lesson on mixed design ANOVA, we only worked the first of two experiments reported in the study. Participants (\emph{N} = 193), all who were White, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they watched six episodes of the sitcom \href{http://www.friends-tv.org/}{\emph{Friends}} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie}{\emph{Little Mosque on the Prairie}}. The sitcoms and specific episodes were selected after significant pilot testing. The selection was based on the tension selecting stimuli that were as similar as possible, yet the intervention-oriented sitcom needed to invoke psychological processes known to reduce prejudice. The authors felt that both series had characters that were likable and relateble who were engaged in activities of daily living. The Friends series featured characters who were predominantly White, cis-gendered, and straight. The Little Mosque series portrays the experience Western Muslims and Arabs as they live in a small Canadian town. This study involved assessment across three waves: baseline (before watching the assigned episodes), post1 (immediately after watching the episodes), and post2 (completed 4-6 weeks after watching the episodes).

The study used \emph{feelings and liking thermometers}, rating their feelings and liking toward 10 different groups of people on a 0 to 100 sliding scale (with higher scores reflecting greater liking and positive feelings). For the purpose of this analysis, the ratings of attitudes toward White people and attitudes toward Arabs/Muslims were used. A third metric was introduced by subtracting the attitudes towards Arabs/Muslims from the attitudes toward Whites. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes toward Whites where as low scores indicated no difference in attitudes. To recap, there were three potential dependent variables, all continuously scaled:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AttWhite: attitudes toward White people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  AttArab: attitudes toward Arab people; higher scores reflect greater liking
\item
  Diff: the difference between AttWhite and AttArab; higher scores reflect a greater liking for White people
\end{itemize}

With random assignment, nearly equal cell sizes, a condition with two levels (Friends, Little Mosque), and three waves (baseline, post1, post2), this is perfect for mixed design ANOVA but suitable for an ANCOVA demonstration.

There is also a caseID (repeated three times across the three waves) and rowID (giving each observation within each case an ID).

Let's check the structure. We want

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rowID and caseID to be unordered factors,
\item
  Wave and COND to be ordered factors,\\
\item
  AttArab, AttWhite, and Diff to be numerical
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{str}\NormalTok{(Murrar\_df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'data.frame':   579 obs. of  7 variables:
 $ rowID   : Factor w/ 579 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ caseID  : Factor w/ 193 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

 $ Diff    : num  25.71 23.18 42.67 1.92 29.01 ...
\end{verbatim}

The structure looks satisfactory. R will automatically ``order'' factors alphabetically or numerically. In this lesson's example the alphabettical ordering (i.e., Baseline, Post1, Post2; Friends, LittleMosque) is consistent with the logic in our study.

If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv (``Excel lite'') or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. This is what I would do. \emph{Note: My students and I have discovered that the the psych::describeBy() function seems to not work with files in the .rds format, but does work when the data are imported with .csv.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with}

\CommentTok{\#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file}
\CommentTok{\#Murrar\_df \textless{}{-} readRDS("Murrar\_RDS.rds")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The code for .csv will likely lose the formatting (i.e., stripping Wave and COND of their ordered factors), but it is easy to view in Excel.

\hypertarget{scenario-1-controlling-for-the-pretest}{%
\section{Scenario \#1: Controlling for the pretest}\label{scenario-1-controlling-for-the-pretest}}

So that we can begin to understand how the covariate operates, we are going to predict attitudes towards Arabs at post-test (AttArabP1) by condition (COND), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline (AttArabB). You may notice that in this analysis we are ignoring the second post-test. This is because I am simply demonstrating ANCOVA. To ignore the second post test would be a significant loss of information.

\hypertarget{preparing-the-data-1}{%
\subsection{Preparing the data}\label{preparing-the-data-1}}

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a pretest, we need three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Little Mosque conditions
\item
  DV that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at post1
\item
  Covariate that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at baseline
\end{itemize}

The form of our data matters. The simulation created a \emph{long} form (formally called the \emph{person-period} form) of data. That is, each observation for each person is listed in its own row. In this dataset where we have 193 people with 3 observation (baseline, post1, post2) each, we have 579 rows. In ANCOVA where we use the pre-test as a covariate, we need all the data to be on a single row.This is termed the \emph{person level} form of data. We can restructure the data with the \emph{data.table} and \emph{reshape2}()* packages.

\subsection{Checking the assumptions}\label{checking-the-assumptions}}

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  random sampling
\item
  independence in the scores representing the dependent variable

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    there is, of course, intentional dependence in any repeated measures or within-subjects variable
  \end{itemize}
\item
  linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
\item
  homogeneity of the regression slopes
\item
  a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
\item
  homogeneity of variance
\end{itemize}

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

\hypertarget{linearity-assumption}{%
\subsubsection{Linearity assumption}\label{linearity-assumption}}

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable. In our case this means that there is linearity between the pre-test (covariate) and post-test (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between covariate (our pretest) and the outcome (post-test1).

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group. The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate. The plotted regression lines should be parallel.

Because the statistically significant interaction term is violation of homogeneity of regression slopes (\emph{F} {[}1, 189{]} = 4.297, \emph{p} = .040, \(\eta^2\) = 0.022) we should not proceed with ANCOVA as a statistical option. However, for the sake of demonstration, I will continue. One of the reasons I wanted to work this example as ANCOVA is to demonstrate that covariates and moderators each have their role. We can already see how this data is best analyzed with mixed design ANOVA.

\hypertarget{normality-of-residuals}{%
\subsubsection{Normality of residuals}\label{normality-of-residuals}}

Our goal here is to specify a model and extract \emph{residuals}: the difference between the observed value of the DV and its predicted value. Each data point has one residual. The sum and mean of residuals are equal to 0.

Once we have saved the residuals, we can treat them as data and evaluate the shape of their distribution. We hope that the distribution is not statistically significantly different from a normal one. We first compute the model with \emph{lm()} (lm stands for ``linear model''). This is a linear regression.

We do have one outlier with a standardized residual that has an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this. If this were ``for real'' I might more closely inspect these data. I would look at the whole response. If any response seemed invalid (e.g., random, extreme, or erratic responding) I would delete it. If the responses seemed valid, I \emph{could} truncate them to exactly 3 SEs or. I could also ignore it. Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} has a great section on some of these options.

As noted by the suggestion of an interaction effect, our preliminary analyses suggests that ANCOVA is not the best option. We know from the prior lesson that a mixed design ANOVA worked well. In the spirit of an example, here's a preliminary write-up so far:

\hypertarget{write-up-of-assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Write-up of Assumptions}\label{write-up-of-assumptions}}

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs expressed by the participant at post-test and covariate was the pre-test assessment of the same variable. A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable, \emph{F} (1, 189) = 4.297, \emph{p} = .040, \(\eta^2\) = 0.022. Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,\emph{W} = 0.984, \emph{p} = .026. Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \emph{F}(1, 191) = 3.515, \emph{p} = .062.

\hypertarget{calculating-the-omnibus-anova}{%
\subsection{Calculating the Omnibus ANOVA}\label{calculating-the-omnibus-anova}}

We are ready to conduct the omnibus ANOVA.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_omnibus.jpg}
\caption{Image of the ANCOVA workflow, showing our current place in the process.}
\end{figure}

\emph{Order of variable entry} matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the \emph{controlling for} language associate with covariates, we want to remove the effect of the covariate before we run the one-way ANOVA. With this ANCOVA we are asking the question, ``Does the condition (Friends or Little Mosque) contribute to more positive attitudes toward Arabs, when controlling for the pre-test score?''

In repeated measures projects, we expect there to be dependency in the data. That is, in most cases prior waves will have significant prediction on later waves. When ANCOVA uses a prior asssessment or wave as a covariate, that variable ``claims'' as much variance as possible and the subsequent variable can capture what is left over.

In the code below, we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from the condition (Friends or Little Mosque), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline.

The \emph{ges} column provides the effect size, \(\eta^2\) where a general rule-of-thumb for interpretation is .02 (small), .13 (medium), and .26 (large) \citep{lakens_calculating_2013}.

Not surprisingly (since this single pairwise comparison is redundant with the omnibus ANCOVA), results suggest a statistically significant difference between Friends and Little Mosque at Post1.

With the script below we can obtain the covariate-adjusted marginal means. These are termed \emph{estimated marginal means.} Take a look at these and compare them to what we would see in the regular descriptives. It is helpful to see the grand mean (AttArabB) and then the marginal means (emmean).

Unlike the figure we created when we were testing assumptions, this script creates a plot from the model (which identifies AttArabB in its role as covariate). Thus, the relationship between condition and AttArabP1 controls for the effect of the AttArabB covariate.

\textbf{Results}

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs expressed by the participant at post-test and covariate was the baseline assessment of the same variable. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable, \emph{F} (1, 189) = 4.297, \emph{p} = .040, \(\eta^2\) = 0.022. Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,\emph{W} = 0.984, \emph{p} = .026. Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, \emph{F}(1, 191) = 3.515 \emph{p} = .062.

There was a non-significant effect of the baseline covariate on the post-test (\emph{F}{[}1, 190{]} = 0.665, \emph{p} = .416, \(\eta^2\) = 0.003). After controlling for the baseline attitudes toward Arabs, there was a statistically significant effect of condition on post-test attitudes toward Arabs, \emph{F}(1,190) = 26.361, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2\) = 0.122. This appears to be moderate in size. Given there were only two conditions, no further follow-up was required. As illustrated in Figure 1, results suggest that those in the Little Mosque condition (\emph{M} = 73.92, \emph{SD} = 18.51) had more favorable attitudes toward Arabs than those in the Friends condition (\emph{M} = 59.02, \emph{SD} = 21.65). Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.

\section{Scenario \#2: Controlling for a confounding or covarying variable}\label{scenario-2-controlling-for-a-confounding-or-covarying-variable}}

In the scenario below, I am simulating a one-way ANCOVA, predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 as a function of sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque), controlling for the participants' attitudes toward Whites. That is, the ANCOVA will compare the the means of the two groups (at post1, only), adjusted for level of attitudes toward Whites

TO BE CLEAR: This is not the best way to analyze this data. With such a strong, balanced design, the multi-way, mixed design ANOVAs were an excellent choice that provided much fuller information than this demonstration, below. The purpose of this over-simplified demonstration is merely to give another example of using a variable as a \emph{covariate} rather than a \emph{moderator.}

\hypertarget{preparing-the-data-2}{%
\subsection{Preparing the data}\label{preparing-the-data-2}}

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a potentially confounding variable, we need three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Littls Mosque sitcom conditions.
\item
  DV that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Arabs at post1 (AttArabP1).
\item
  Covariate that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Whites at post1 (AttWhiteP1). \emph{Note} We could have also chosen attitudes toward Whites at baseline.
\end{itemize}

We can continue using the Murrar\_wide df.

\hypertarget{checking-the-assumptions-1}{%
\subsection{Checking the assumptions}\label{checking-the-assumptions-1}}

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  random sampling
\item
  independence in the scores representing the dependent variable
\item
  linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
\item
  homogeneity of the regression slopes
\item
  a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
\item
  homogeneity of variance
\end{itemize}

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

\hypertarget{linearity-assumption-1}{%
\subsubsection{Linearity assumption}\label{linearity-assumption-1}}

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable. In our case this means that there is linearity between the attitudes toward Whites (covariate) and attitudes toward Arabs (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between the covariate (attitudes toward Whites) and the outcome (attitudes toward Arabs).

As we look at this scatterplot, we are trying to determine if there is an interaction effect (rather than a covarying effect). The linearity here, looks reasonable and not terribly ``interacting'' (to help us decide whether empathy should be a covariate or a moderator). More testing can help us make this distinction.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes-1}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of regression slopes}\label{homogeneity-of-regression-slopes-1}}

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group. The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate. The plotted regression lines should be parallel.

\hypertarget{normality-of-residuals-1}{%
\subsubsection{Normality of residuals}\label{normality-of-residuals-1}}

Assessing the normality of residuals means running the model, capturing the unexplained portion of the model (i.e., the \emph{residuals}), and then seeing if they are normally distributed. Proper use of ANCOVA is predicated on normally distributed residuals.

We first compute the model with \emph{lm()}. The \emph{lm()} function is actually testing what we want to test. However, at this early stage, we are just doing a ``quick run and interpretation'' to see if we are within the assumptions of ANCOVA.

The statistically significant Shapiro Wilk test indicate a violation of the normality assumption (\emph{W} = 0.984, \emph{p} = .029). As I mentioned before, there are better ways to analyze this research vignette. None-the-less, we will continue with this demonstration so that you will have the procedural and conceptual framework for conducting ANCOVA.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-of-variances-1}{%
\subsubsection{Homogeneity of variances}\label{homogeneity-of-variances-1}}

ANCOVA presumes that the variance of the residuals is equal for all groups. We can check this with the Levene's test.

Contributing more evidence that ANCOVA is not the best way to analyze this data, a statistically significant Levene's test indicates a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 4.539, \emph{p} = .034).

\hypertarget{outliers-1}{%
\subsubsection{Outliers}\label{outliers-1}}

We can identify outliers by examining the standardized (or studentized) residual. This is the residual divided by its estimated standard error. Standardized residuals are interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line.

There is one outlier with a standardized residual with an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this. If this were ``for real'' I might more closely inspect these data. I would look at the whole response. If any response seems invalid (e.g., random, erratic, or extreme responding) I would delete it. If the response seem valid, I \emph{could} truncate them to within 3 SEs. I could also ignore it. Kline \citeyearpar{kline_principles_2016} has a great section on some of these options.

\hypertarget{write-up-of-assumptions-1}{%
\subsubsection{Write-up of Assumptions}\label{write-up-of-assumptions-1}}

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. Preliminary anlayses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable (\emph{F} {[}1, 189{]} = 1.886, \emph{p} = .171, \(\eta^2\) = 0.010) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption. In contrast, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was statistically significant (\emph{W} = 0.984, \emph{p} = .029). This means that we likely violated the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. Regarding outliers, one datapoint (-3.38) had a standardized residual that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. Further, a statistically significant Levene's test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 4.539, \emph{p} = .034). \emph{Because the intent of this analysis was to demonstrate how ANCOVA differs from mixed design ANOVA we proceeded with the analysis. Were this for ``real research'' we would have chosen a different analysis.}

\emph{Order of variable entry} matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the \emph{controlling for} language associated with covariates, we firstly want to remove the effect of the covariate.

In the code below we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from attitudes toward Whites at post1 (the covariate) and sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque).

The \emph{ges} column provides the effect size, \(\eta^2\) where a general rule-of-thumb for interpretation is .01 (small), .06 (medium), and .14 (large) \citep{lakens_calculating_2013}.

Unlike the figure we created when we were testing assumptions, this script creates a plot from the model (which identifies AttWhiteP1 in its role as covariate). Thus, the relationship between condition and AttArabP1 controls for the effect of the AttArabB covariate.

\textbf{Results}

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels: Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. Preliminary analyses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable (\emph{F} {[}1, 189{]} = 1.886, \emph{p} = .171, \(\eta^2\) = 0.010) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption. In contrast, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was statistically significant (\emph{W} = 0.984, \emph{p} = .029). This means that we likely violated the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. Regarding outliers, one datapoint (-3.38) had a standardized residual that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. Further, a statistically significant Levene's test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, (\emph{F}{[}1, 191{]} = 4.539, \emph{p} = .034). \emph{Because the intent of this analysis was to demonstrate how ANCOVA differs from mixed design ANOVA we proceeded with the analysis. Were this for ``real research'' we would have chosen a different analysis.}

There was a non-significant effect of the attitudes toward Whites covariate on the attitudes toward Arabs post-test, \emph{F} (1,190) = 0.014, \emph{p} = .907, \(\eta^2\) \textless{} .001. After controlling for attitudes toward Whites, there was a statistically significant effect in attitudes toward Arabs at post-test between the conditions, \emph{F}(1. 190) = 26.119, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2\) = 0.121. The effect size was moderately large. Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.

\hypertarget{more-and-a-recap-on-covariates}{%
\section{More (and a recap) on covariates}\label{more-and-a-recap-on-covariates}}

Covariates, sometimes termed \emph{controls} are often used to gain statistical control over variables that are difficult to control in a research design. That is, it may be impractical for polychotomize an otherwise continuous variable and/or it is impractical to have multiple factors and so a covariate is a more manageable approach. Common reasons for including covariates include \citep{bernerth_critical_2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  they mathematically remove variance associated with nonfocal variables,
\item
  the \emph{purification principle} -- removing unwanted or confusing variance,
\item
  they remove the \emph{noise} in the analysis to clear up the clear up the relationship between IV and DVs.
\end{itemize}

Perhaps it is an oversimplification, but we can think of three categories of variables: moderators, covariates, and mediators. Through ANOVA and ANCOVA, we distinguish between moderator and covariate.

\textbf{Moderator}: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

\textbf{Covariate}: an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable. It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Bernerth and Aguinis \citeyearpar{bernerth_critical_2016} conducted a review of how and when control variables were used in nearly 600 articles published between 2003 and 2012. Concurrently with their analysis, they provided guidance for when to use control variables (covariates). The flowchart that accompanies their article is quite helpful. Control variables (covariates) should only be used when:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Theory suggests that the potential covariate(s) relate(s) to variable(s) in the currrent study.
\item
  There is empirical justification for including the covariate in the study.
\item
  The covariate can be measured reliably.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-5}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that offer differing levels of difficulty. Whichever you choose, you will focus on these larger steps in one-way ANCOVA, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  test the statistical assumptions
\item
  conduct an ANCOVA
\item
  if the predictor variable has more three or more levels, conduct follow-up testing
\item
  present both means and coviarate-adjusted means
\item
  write a results section to include a figure and tables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-3}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-3}}

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If ANCOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210813)'' from 210813 to something else. Then rework Scenario\#1, Scenario\#2, or both. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
\item
  If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
\item
  If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.
\end{itemize}
